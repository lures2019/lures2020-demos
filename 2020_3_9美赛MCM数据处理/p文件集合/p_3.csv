I gave her a Soothie to use before, and bought this thinking I'd only use it as back up or when we go somewhere because it has a handle that I can attach a holder/clip.  The first time I had my baby used this, I could see by the way that she was sucking it that it was a lot more comfortable and fit better in her mouth than the Soothie. Because the nipple is softer, more flattened, and has a narrow base, the pacifier stays in her mouth better than the Soothie.  It will stay in her mouth sometimes the entire length of her nap or for a few hours each night before falling out, even after she stopped sucking.  With the Soothie, it kept falling out of her mouth as soon as she stopped sucking.  The other day, I tried to give her her Soothie back to try again, and she sucked it and it fell out of her mouth. I kept putting it back in, but either she pushed it out with her tongue, or it was falling out because of the way she was sucking (she was used to how this pacifier kinda &#34;hangs&#34; in mouth better because of the narrow base and fatter nipple). So I actually tried sucking on both pacifiers myself - this one is MUCH softer and natural feeling than the stiff, straight nipple of the Soothie.  If I was a baby, I'd definitely prefer sucking on this one! I personally think it probably resembles a real nipple more because of its soft, compressed/flatter nipple.  I breastfeed, and when my baby feeds, my nipple looks flattened when she pulls off.<br /><br />The only negative about this pacifier is that water gets into the inside of the pacifier whenever I wash them.  I always wash them by hand with some warm water and soap and ALWAYS get water into the nipple.  It leaks in somehow from the base.  I don't think there's a way to take of the base without breaking it to clean the inside.  But I guess it doesn't matter because that part doesn't come in contact with my baby's mouth.  It is unsightly though seeing water spots on the inside of the nipple (makes it look dirty). We have really hard water though, so that may be why.  I always shake the water out as much as I can and let it air dry before giving it to my baby.",8/9/2015

They have a nub to hold onto with is great because it provides a decent handle to hold onto but the babies don't grab onto them and pull them out so easily.  The glow in the dark feature is great too, makes them easy to locate in the crib at night.",8/7/2015

I thought they were just stuffed animals attached to pacifiers.  I didn't realize I needed one until I was at the pediatricians office with my two month old and another mom showed me what they did while my daughter kept spitting out her pacifier.  Quickly, I ran to amazon and purchased the pacifier.  It took a couple days to come in but the shipping was super fast and I immediately cleaned it and put it to use.  It works great.  My two month old is just getting to the stage where she is starting to grab for things in reach and she likes her pacifier sometimes when she is over tired (despite my best efforts for naps) to help her settle down.  I haven't used it in the car yet, which is where I need it most, but I'm sure it'll be great.  It's nice that it stays in range and when she spits her paci out she can easily get it back in with a little effort.<br /><br />The only downfall I see with the design of the product is that you can't take the paci off to really clean it.  Yes you can wash it in soapy water like the instructions say and I did that.  I just wish I could run it through my dishwasher like I do the other things to make sure it's really sterilized.  But, then I'm kinda germaphobic when it comes to my little one.  Definitely worth the price and definitely a great idea.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft and the little caterpillar is just the right size that my daughter's tiny hands can really grab onto it.  She seems to like the soft feel.  The little feet have beans in them so that it helps the animal stay on her chest when she is laying in her car seat or swing and needs a little extra soothing.  The pacifier is sewn into the stuffed animal part so there is no worry about fingers or anything getting caught in a loop or something like that.  The fabrics are bright and cute.

Flexible? Rigid? Small? Or Big? I went through pages and reviews and got more confused. Some of them look fashion but I really worried about whether they are practical for me. After all, it is just a diaper bag.<br />I asked my friends whose baby girl is already 3 years old. She told me that you got to buy a diaper bag that is big enough especially when you have twin. That is the most important. Soon you will find it extremely helpful because there is never too many baby stuff to carry. She really have the point.<br />This bag is big and light enough for me. There are some points that I like about it.<br />-It doesn’t have too complex compartments inside which I like. It is easy for me to put things in and take out.<br />-The fabric inside is plastic which is easy to clean in case of bottle leakage. The material is good quality. It doesn’t have that kind of smell which is really not healthy for holding baby stuff.<br />-It has two side pocket and a large pocket for diaper. That is thoughtful because they are the thing you need handy such as diaper or bottle of milk. You need it immediately most of the time.<br />-It surprises me that it also has a transparent plastic bag. I use it to hold dirty or wet clothes. Very thoughtful.<br /><br />List of things I bring for a day out in case you need to know:<br />-A double stroller for my two children which our diaper bag can be easily attached.<br />-change of clothes<br />-diaper for two child.<br />-medicine like vitamins.<br />-paper handkerchief<br />-talc<br />-First aid kit<br />-pacifiers<br />-milk and two bottles.<br />-my wallet<br />-book.

And with him at daycare this also acts as his &#34;lovey&#34; from home and helps him to self sooth. The only problem at daycare is that all of the other babies want one too. :),7/6/2015

I was hoping that it would be more like Soothies, but with a more bulbous tip so that it would stay in his mouth better.  Regardless, it doesn't seem to bother him.<br /><br />My favorite part about this pacifier though, is that when he drops it, it almost always with the mouth-part up.  Or 'butter-side-up' as it were.  The oval part is heavier, perhaps on purpose, so it almost always turns the pacifier 'in-flight' and lands in the ideal position.  Of course, a tether would be even better so that it couldn't be dropped on the floor at all.  But as I mentioned my son isn't a fan of pacifiers, so we don't have one leashed to him 24/7.",7/2/2015

These Soothies have saved my sanity many nights and are excellent in that I dont have to worry about water collecting in the pacifier BUT the older (and chunkier) my infant is getting the more her little thick fingers are get stuck in the center of the pacifier. When learning to pull her pacifier to her mouth and play with it she almost always gets her thumb stuck in the pacifier center. I am a hawk over my baby so her finger never stays in there for long but the suction created makes it difficult to remove the pacifier from her finger at times. After struggling with this issue for 3 days I finally got her a competitors pacifier that is very similar in design to reduce my anxierty and her risk of injury associated with her finger being lodged in the pacifier's nipple/ center.,6/7/2015

My daughter loved these from the time she was born until she was two and it RUINED her teeth and her bite. She has a cross bite now and the dentist says she is going to need a ton of orthodontics when she gets older. I thought it was no big deal at first and would just impact her baby teeth. WRONG.  A pacifier can change the way the teeth grow in and a child's bite---and adult teeth are going to come in the same way the baby teeth are.  If you use a pacifier, I highly recommend using one with a better shape that won't impact the teeth as much.  You can read descriptions of other pacifiers that will say things like &#34; promote healthy oral development by naturally fitting into your baby's palate&#34;.

I introduced it at a little over month originally because she had such a horrible time keeping pacifiers in her mouth! She would get so frustrated and angry. While the WubbaNub didn't solve ALL of our issues, it certainly helped. My daughter is exclusively breastfed and isn't really fond of pacifiers, but she absolutely adores her WubbaNub tiger. Now that she's older (4 months), she likes to hold on to his little legs or pet it. She honestly spends more time with the stuffed animal part than the pacifier!<br /><br />Her caretakers at daycare noticed how much it soothes her. We forgot it one day and well, let's just say that wasn't a good day for anyone... I think it's adorable that it gives her both something to suck on (and sometimes gnaw on), as well as comfort with the stuffed animal. I'll be sad when we have to take it away when she actually starts sprouting teeth! We'll probably just cut it off the pacifier and sew it closed, ha.<br /><br />To clean it, I usually just wipe off the pacifier. Since she takes it to daycare, I'll handwash the tiger in Dapple soap at least once every week or so and then hang it to dry.",3/25/2015

We've tried A LOT of bottles and he prefers the MAMs over everything else. For him, the nipples on Dr. Browns and Born free are too long. He hated the Avent Naturals because he had to smoosh his face into them to get a full latch. He is OK with Nuks but he prefers the MAMs. I think that the shape of the nipple just really works for him. It is wider and flatter than most bottle nipples. They say it mimics the breast - that isn't our issue as I use a nipple shield. He also seems to have less gas, due to the venting system. That all said, it is true that these can leak from the base if you don't assemble them correctly. It has happened to me, I know now to double check the base before I pour milk in. In addition, the venting system in designed in such a way that if you heat up milk directly in these by putting a bottle in warm water, you'll get water in the underside that will drip out when feeding. Since the plastic is fairly thick on these, I just heat up the milk in a Medela bottle and transfer to one of these to feed.",3/23/2015

Fantastic natural pacifier.,"These are my (and my baby's) favorite pacifiers. I love them because they are natural rubber, made of one piece (so no hidden moisture/mold/bacteria issues) and have the lowered curve to go below the nose. The handle is also super easy for my baby to hold and bends easily in case she falls asleep with it and rolls to the side. It doesn't poke her in the face like others I've used. We also have the Ummy and while it's similar I don't like how big the base is...it covers too much of my baby's face for my comfort, despite the holes in it. It's also harder to figure out which way is 'up' when it's dark and I'm trying to quickly put the pacifier in so she can fall back asleep...having the dipped curve in the base makes it to much easier. Since the whole thing is rubber my now teething baby likes to gum the entire thing when she's not using it for its intended purpose. It's kind of funny to watch.  I was at Whole Foods the other day and saw the Eco Piggy, which I almost bought to try but didn't based on the reviews of the bulb part being huge. So I took it out to look at it and sure enough, it's massive! Unless you have a mammoth sized baby I'd skip that one. We're both happy with the Natursutten so I'm sticking to this one.  For those who have complained about the rubber smell/taste...just wash and sterilize it a couple of times and that goes away.",2/28/2015

They aren't the best looking brand out there but they seem to be very functional at calming a new baby.

I wish the part that sticks out of the babies mouth was smaller because when you are trying to take pictures it feels like it's covering the babies entire face!!

We got our first one even our daughter was 4 months old and we haven't looked back even though she is now 17 months and well past the she listing on the package. Mr Monkey helped our daughter learn to self soothe early on as it was easier for her to find in the dark of her crib at night and even before she could figure out how to get the pacifier back in her mouth she was at least able to pull his foot or arm up to her face and that seemed to calm her. We've glove through a few of them now that she has most of her teeth but it's well worth buying replacements as her monkey still is her favorite soother. When she's fussy we just ask her to go adds find Mr Monkey and that usually does the trick to calm her down.<br /><br />For those with concerns about keeping it clean, I just throw the whole thing in the washer (we also have the giraffe version of this so we always have one available while the other is being washed). When it comes out of the dryer I just hand wash the pacifier part to rid it of any fuzz or residue and there you have it, a fresh clean wubbanub. ;-)",2/21/2015

I purchased in Sept 2014 but did not begin using it until my baby arrived home on Oct 20th 2014.  Overnight it finally $h*t itself completely.  The monitor no longer connects with the camera, nothing I do works, it's fried.  So that is the end of the slow and painful death of my Levana Keera - it took just four months, and definitely not worth the $160ish bucks I handed over for it.<br /><br />At the beginning (before any issues began). I thought it was an average product, I did like the camera pan feature, but that's about it,  picture quality during the day was ok, the more light the better, but not helpful if your baby needs the room for sleeping.  Night vision was very blurry, I could never make out if my babies eyes were open or closed.<br />The wireless connectivity between camera and monitor has always been patchy, cutting in and out, often the sound would not transmit, it would either cut in and out or go completely out until I would realize and have to manually reconnect or par the two.  Also the monitor would constantly default back to the menu screen, so I would glance at the monitor only to see a bunch of icons, not reliable whatsoever.<br /><br />I wasted my money, and now I need to spend more doe on a new baby monitor, hopefully my next purchase serves me better.",2/20/2015

After struggling a bit and failing to be able to use the syringe/plungers that come with the over the counter medicines we purchased several products to try something else. This was the best out of the ones that we tried and we have been using this exclusively for several months since.<br /><br />You can use this as a syringe to suck up the medicine from the bottle but for something like Motrin where the dosage is a small volume I found it  more accurate to use the one that comes in the Motrin box and then transfer it to the mini medicator. This method does require you to be careful and can make a mess. So my only knock on this product would be that it is not easy to transfer medicine to it if you do not use it as a syringe. After squirting medicine all over the kitchen in the middle of the night one time I have gotten the prep down now.<br /><br />As far as administering medicine it works quite well. The shield prevents spilling back out and the design shoots the medicine off to the sides of the mouth which does not choke our kid if he's on his back like the out of the box syringes would.,2/10/2015

We needed a stroller that would travel well without sacrificing all features, like most umbrella strollers. Our usual stroller is a Britax b ready, so this is a huge difference.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Assembly was easy- all wheels come unattached, as well as the umbrella.<br />The recline option is easy to work, no different really than tightening the bottom of a coat.<br />Handles are comfortable to hold and seem to be a perfect height (5'8&#34;). I suspect others that will use it that are much taller will be comfortable as well.<br />The cup holder! There is a storage sack/built in cup holder affixed to the top<br />Large umbrella with matching dot trim covers significant area<br />Storage basket seems large enough to hold a diaper bag and coat<br /><br />No Cons as of yet.<br /><br />I second that this is the same as the Ignite stroller by the First Years. I gave significant consideration to purchasing that instead, but the brand is really a moot point for this to me. The product registration form even references that this is an Ignite model. Price point was about $15 less to go with this model vs the Ignite.<br /><br />Lastly, the colors are much more muted than pictured- I was concerned that the stroller looked girly, but honestly the colors are gender neutral. Highly recommend.",2/6/2015

Got one as a baby gift and frankly thought it was kind of dumb. I mean, if you want a pacifier and a little stuffed animal, why do they need to be stuck together?!? And then when our son still wasn't really hooked on any particular pacifier after the first couple weeks, and after one long evening of paci-spitting and fussing, I figured we might as well try the Wubbanub. Our son loved it pretty much instantly! And the genius design of that stuffed animal meant the paci couldn't drop out of his mouth and get stuck under his neck/head. It rested perfectly on his chest while he was tiny and stayed close and easy to grab when he was a little bigger. And while I fully expected him to abandon it by the time he was crawling, he loves that thing still! It's lightweight enough that he never minded it dangling from his mouth as he became mobile. He's over 20 months now (entering the territory of restricting it to the crib, car, and emotional moments), but it's easy for us to grab and hang onto with a toddler on the go. With him on my hip and the paci in his mouth, the giraffe is long enough that I can hook a leg or tail between my fingers in case he jettisons the thing. I'm actually ordering a new one because he finally chewed a hole in his and I don't have the heart to take it away. Can't believe I'm buying a Wubbanub for my toddler, but a lovey is a lovey for a reason, and he sure does love this giraffe.",1/30/2015

I was concerned as I have Fibromyalgia and can hardly open jars, heavy doors and other things with my hands. I took the chance and bought one, hey it was only $3.99 with free shipping! When I received the case I immediately went to open it with the provided latch and yes it was difficult but I found a more than easier way to open the case. If you squeeze the two sides of the case, it instantly pops open. I barely have to put pressure on the case and its quickly open. Yes, I realize the latch should be easy to open but I found this way worked and seems to be a great way. This easily fits two soothie pacifiers in the case. The clip is a little flimsy but I believe it's made that way so you can clip it on nearly anywhere. I think an improvement would be an actual caribeanner clip to ensure it doesn't fall off.

It does not have the typical bulb shape that is flexible.  Instead the plastic of the entire pacifier is sturdier.  In the babies mouth, the pacifier does not bend and catch on the babies gums.  Because of this, the pacifier will fall out of the babies mouth when they are sound asleep.  This is actually a good thing because it teaches baby that they need to self-soothe at night time.  As I mentioned earlier, the shape and texture are different - very similar to a thumb.  Since this is so similar to the thumb, your baby might choose to self soothe by sucking on their thumb.  While this can be good because they will stop using the pacifier on their own, it can be a problem if they continue to suck their thumb months later.",1/2/2015

I had received one of these sample pacifiers in the mail so I popped it in her mouth and she immediately quieted down, started sucking and fell asleep.  I ordered this 5 pack right away after that and have not been disappointed.  The only thing I do not like is that this brand does not make a pacifier clip.  I ended up using a JJ Cole pacifier loop that can loop through the hole on the end and then clip to her clothing.  Also, these pacifiers can be a little tricky to clean so I use the narrow end of a bottle brush to clean them and then sterilize them in the microwave.

I wanted my LO to use the Nattursutten pacifier because it's made of all natural rubber and is one piece (no space or hole for bacterial growth) but even though I purchased the butterfly shape, it was so big that it covered my LO's nose. And my LO is quite large for his age so it wasn't because of his size.  Other moms complain about the same design flaw, too.<br /><br />My second choice was the Gumdrop pacifier because although it isn't made of the same high quality material as the Nattursutten, it was one piece so again, no holes for bacteria to grow in.  But the pacifier was so heavy that my LO couldn't keep it in his mouth and I didn't want my LO to have to use so much force when using a binky.  Just logically speaking, I would think the LO's jaws would hurt from holding something so heavy for so long.<br /><br />So then I tried Advent and Dr. Brown which were lighter in weight but also covered the nostrils.<br /><br />I ended up using MAMS pacifiers only because they were super lightweight and didn't obstruct my LO's breathing at all.  But they are a pain to clean- the part that the LO sucks on is hollow so soap and spit get stuck in there.  After awhile, it turned murky in color despite my obsessive washing.<br /><br />As soon as my LO was older, I again tried the Nattersutten.  Still same problem- covered his entire nose.  Back to Gumdrop and thank goodness, this time, my LO was able to hold it in his mouth on the first try.<br /><br />I'm still not 100% satisfied with it because I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy and why the nipple is hollow (makes cleaning a pain).  Oh and the design makes LO look like Hannibal Lecter.  It's a bit disturbing to me.  Haha. But for now, my concern about bacteria growth in the MAMS binkies outweighs these issues.<br /><br />Until Nattersutten creates a pacifier with a deeper dip in the nostril area, I recommend the Gumdrop version.",12/27/2014

However, I became a convert around the five month mark when I started putting baby to sleep with this guy in her crib and found that she was able to find the pacifier when it fell out thanks to the critter attached. I even went so far as to buy another one because it was working so well. Even though my daughter is now almost eight months, we still use these as her 'night-time' pacifiers for the reason above. Not to mention I think she finds comfort even in holding onto the animal even if the pacifier is out of her mouth. Another idea I read about in a magazine is to cut the pacifier off when you are trying to wean baby. This still allows them to have something familiar and cozy, but the paci is gone.

Do yourself a favor and don't bother with novelty pacifiers with mustaches and funny sayings. These fit perfectly in baby's mouth no matter how which direction it goes in. Once the baby learns how to put their pacifier in their mouths, it's easy for them to do and since they glow in the dark, it's easy to find in the crib at night. I'm not a fan of the clear ones because they're hard for him to find. To the reviewer who said the pacifiers make her baby drool, that's like saying a specific diaper makes your baby poop.

They are great for so many reasons: 1. They are easy to find, and don't get lost - I have exclusively used one binky for the last 5 months compared to the dozens I had gone through with my other two kids by the same time, saving $$ as well! (They are also much easier to find than just a single little binky in the dark or in the car!) 2. My baby has learned how to put his own binky in his mouth MONTHS earlier than my others did. Since it is so much bigger - much less dexterity and coordination is necessary to get it in his own mouth! 3. It STAYS in place. This is the kicker for me. Especially as a newborn, before they really have the suction power to keep their binky in - when they spit out their bink half-way, it doesn't fall out completely = less trips for mom and dad to put it back in their mouth! 4. Although this is just anticipation, when it's time to wean off of the binky, I think it will be much easier to just cut off the actual binky and let them play with the animal for comfort. Hopefully it will be an easier transition by letting them keep some of what they have become attached to.<br /><br />After 5 months of constant use, our binky is starting to tear where it is stitched to the animal. Honestly, this does not concern me at all given the fact that we use it all the time. If I only need one binky every 5-6 months, I'm one happy mama!",12/2/2014

I have bought a lot of specialty baby items because they were supposed to be amazing and help their child develop and make parenting easier.  Most of the items I have gotten just sit in a box after being examined by the baby once and then tossed away in a fit of indifference.<br /><br />One thing that my baby has loved since day 2 has been a pacifier.  She is a big pacifier baby.  I learned quickly that even though young babies can't control their movements and can't throw things, a pacifier that just falls out of their mouth still has the ability to roll far enough away to never be found again.<br /><br />Wubbanubs actually solve this problem.  When a pacifier falls, it can't go far.  If it is thrown, it is easily found.  And when babies start being able to control their hands, they can grasp the stuffed animal and bring it to their mouth much earlier than they would be able to with just a normal pacifier.",11/25/2014

Letting out a groan you roll out of bed and stumble to the baby. The baby is still asleep but that won't last long if you can't locate the pacifier. Thank goodness you thought to buy a MAM Night Glow pacifier. Instead blindly feeling around the bed... then crawling around the floor hoping you can find it in time... You spot the pacifier immediately, pop it into baby's mouth and he/she makes that classic Maggie Simpson sucking noise. Silently you tip-toe back to bed and hope it lasts...<br /><br />Bottom line: Even if it's been hours since the pacifier has been exposed to light, it still emits a decent glow so you can locate it in the darkest of rooms. I only buy the glow in the dark pacifiers now. Unlike many other pacifiers MAM pacifiers can be put in two ways.... there is no &#34;right side&#34; up.

Having the Elephant attached made it easier to find than normal binkies (which have a way of getting lost in every corner of your car and couch).

I tried multiple pacifiers and none of them were even remotely accepted by her. I was pretty beside myself about it and did a search to see what the most breast-like pacifier was and was led to this one. I placed my order right away, and as soon as it was delivered I opened it up, boiled it, and presented it to my daughter. She didn't care for it until she got a little upset later on, but then she took it right away! She definitely knows the difference between the pacifier and the breast, but she has accepted the pacifier as an &#34;okay&#34; substitute until boob becomes more convenient.

I ordered these on a Friday night and received them on a Sunday! I don't know if anyone else ever received mail on a Sunday from the USPS but it was a first for me and it was amazing to get it so quickly. Now the product; exactly what I expected to receive. I had read that babies that like the soothie but have trouble holding onto it like this pacifier, so I ordered it along with some of the latex nuk (the silicone are all I have in my area and my son hates them, my older son used latex and I read the latex is softer, so here we are 😊) well I sterilized them and then tried to use it, but the difference between these and the soothie is a slight bulb at the end where the soothie is more straight (maybe this is why it's easier to hold on to?). The bulb at the end seems to be slightly large for my sons mouth, he had trouble trying to get it in his mouth. So those were out. Maybe he'll like them when he's a little older ( my son was 6 weeks when we tried these). I would suggest buying these and the regular latex nuk pacifiers and see which they prefer. As a side note, I breastfeed as well as almost all of my friends and we all use pacifiers without any nope confusion, maybe it can cause it but i have never seen it, so if you're breastfeeding but don't agree with the breastfeeding nazis that you should be a pacifier as well as a bottle give the pacifiers a try because i think the risk must be minimal of nipple confusion.",9/1/2014

That being said, my baby loves her soothies, this is easy to find if it falls or is dark, and it's cute. It seems to keep the paci in her mouth a little better. It minorly interferes with breastfeeding; if my baby suckles on this a long time, she'll chew on my nipple a couple times before latching like normal, so wait to introduce this until the baby is a pro at latching.

I originally got the elephant and the giraffe as baby gifts when my son was first born. We have since added the cat, dragon, and owl to our collection and have them stationed around the house and in the diaper bag. My son likes all the animals, but the Owl is by far his favorite. He loves to look at Wubby's eyes and now that he's old enough to hold onto it, he carries it around everywhere. I feel like the Wubbanubs are a good way to start working on hand control and dexterity and my husband loves them because they are easier to catch than just the pacifier when they fall/get tossed. As for cleaning, we give our Wubbies a bath several times a week by putting the pacifier end in boiling water (we call it the Wubby watering hole). I've also washed all our Wubbies multiple times using a garment bag and they do really well (our giraffe popped a seam in the wash, but it was easy to sew back up). To rank all the Wubbanubs we have:<br />1.Owl: Our favorite Wubby. Before he could hold onto it, my son could hug it making it the easiest Wubby to carry around since I didn't have to hold it. The eyes are like magic, my son loves to look at the owl's eyes. Now that he's teething, he also likes to chew Wubby's feet and the edge of the pacifier. It has done great in the wash and will be a great little stuffed toy when we are done with the pacifier.<br />2.Giraffe: This was the first Wubbanub we got and I think it's great for little babies since it's light and thin. My son seems to like the contrasting colors and when he was just learning to grasp things, the giraffe was easiest because it has the two horns a thin neck and a tail to hang onto. It's also very cute and is our second favorite.<br />3. Dragon: The dragon has fun colors (red/blue/orange) and is chunky like the owl so it's easy for little ones to hang onto. The body is thick, but the wings are easy for little hands to grab. Not my son's favorite, but it's pretty cute.<br />4. Cat: Cute colors, and myson likes the kitties feet. It's nothing too exciting, we use it as the back-up most of the time.<br />5. Elephant: Also a chunkier Wubbanub. It hasn't been our favorite, but as my son gets older he's liking it more and more. When we first got it we rarely used it just because it was really big for a tiny baby. At three months old, my son is starting to pay more attention to the elephant's ears and can hang onto its body so we're using it more and more.",8/15/2014

It's the third monitor I purchased, and by far the best.<br /><br />The reason I'm only giving 2 stars is because of Motorola's customer service problems. In the last couple months, the power button has stopped working consistently. I sent an email to support@motorolamonitors.com (the address listed on their site), and it bounced back. I tried again a few days later. Again, it bounced back. I called the customer support line. Nobody ever answered.<br /><br />Leaving aside the question of my broken power button, I find it unsettling that a baby monitor manufacturer doesn't have a functional customer support infrastructure. This is not a mom & pop shop, after all, but a giant multinational corporation. And they don't have a working email address?<br /><br />The first monitor I owned was the Angel Care baby sound monitor -- their customer service was the complete opposite. Personal, prompt, helpful. If that monitor had offered video I would have stuck with it forever.",7/8/2014

I thought the animal attached would keep it from getting knocked too far away from baby, and he could get back in his mouth easier.

Well, the second expectation was true, the first wasn't. the animal isn't heavy or big enough to matter when it comes to baby spitting it out. He can still get it really far away and I have to put it back in. Also, to wash the paci you have to wash it in a washing machine, which is inconvenient so I just rinse off the nipple between washes but it gets the animal wet a lot of times, and then the animal part gets really dirty since I can't wash it in the washing machine constantly.

Each was/is totally devoted to their pacis. Having experience with both types, I prefer this kind. Here's why:<br /><br />These are all one piece. The Nuk's would get a little bit of water inside of the nipple when washed/boiled, and over time would get cloudy and gross inside, and little bits of dust/grime would get stuck in the seam between the hard plastic shell and the nipple. These get totally clean and there are no seams or areas for water or grime to collect.<br /><br />These are all the same semi-soft material. Our baby will chew on the edges to help with teething, and if he face-plants while sucking/chewing (which happened a LOT while learning to crawl) there are no hard areas to hurt him. Landing on the edge of a Nuk can hurt a little.<br /><br />The only annoying thing is that these bounce like crazy when dropped. We have hardwood floors through most of the house and they can easily end up 10 feet away if dropped from adult height while holding baby. We probably have one under most pieces of furniture at our house at any given time. So just accept this and buy a bunch so you have backups. On the plus side, my 3-year-old thinks it is fun to go on a &#34;pacifier hunt&#34; and see how many he can find while slithering under furniture.",6/17/2014

The material seems very durable and it's easy to clean.  We think he may like the shape because it's closer to simulating a nipple or a pinky finger.<br /><br />The shape is a bit different from the 3 other brands we have, but I actually find I like it better.  It doesn't lay flush to the baby's mouth, which allows saliva to run or dry.  With the other pacifiers that curve with baby's face, the saliva just pools around his mouth and caused a little bit of skin irritation.  Our baby may have sensitive skin, but it seems better with this soothie.  One disadvantage is that it pops out easily and has nothing to keep it in place - though I guess we could get around this by fastening it to him, but we were paranoid about having anything hanging around his neck.<br /><br />I guess every baby is different, but our little boy gives the Phillips AVENT soothie for 0-3 months 5 stars.",5/3/2014

She is now exclusively on formula.  When we needed to supplement, I had a horrible time trying to find a bottle that she would take.  I started with the Lanisoh bottles and the Medela bottles because they are supposed to be the best for breastfed babies.  She would not take either of them.  Then I tried First Years Breastflow bottles and Avent.  Again, she would not take either of them.  You can imagine how absolutely stressful this was with a baby who was not thriving.  Eventually we found Dr. Browns and she did take them relatively well, but she always spilled so much formula while eating because the nipples are small and she couldn't &#34;latch&#34; onto the bottle properly.  This made for a big mess and also for a lot of gas because she was sucking a lot of air while trying to eat.  These bottles have BY FAR been the best I have tried with her.  She rarely spills a drop and she is not really gassy on these bottles at all.  Plus, the inclusion of the pacifiers is a wonderful bonus as this is the ONLY paci she will take other than the weird looking Soothies.  She latches to these pacifiers the best, and yes, I have tried MANY MANY brands just as I did with bottles.  These bottles are easy to clean and having the ability to sanitize them in the microwave is a HUGE bonus!!  I find that they don't leak as long as they are assembled correctly.  I also enjoy having the ability to make a 5oz bottle - many bottles only go to 4oz in the smaller size.  Overall, I think these are the best bottles on the market and I highly recommend them.  They have pretty much literally been a lifesaver for us.",4/30/2014

It didn't actually work for us in bed, because my son likes to turn his head to the side when he sleeps--he would pull the elephant off of his chest every single time...  But it is great for the car!  I love that the pacifier doesn't get lost in the car seat, though my son (5 months) still can't get the pacifier in his mouth consistently.  Now that he is teething, he enjoys chewing on the sides of the pacifier and on the elephant's legs.<br /><br />Updated 2014.03.08: One of the elephant's legs did split open recently.  I'm leaving my review at five stars because none of the filling came out even when the opening became quite large (I didn't notice it very quickly).  A very safe toy!",2/18/2014

He's not to the age yet where he can find it in his crib on his own, but with him sleeping in a bassinet next to me, it's easy for me to find in the dark. This is the only binky I use for him at night since with the weight of the stuffed animal, it will stay in his mouth much better. Therefore, more sleep for baby & mommy!  The reason I'm rating it 4 stars is due to the fact that they only offer it with the soothie binky.  My son prefers the gumdrop ones.

Many a times, I've been driving when it falls out of the baby's mouth and I can easily reach back and find it because of the stuffed animal being attached.<br />-Baby &#34;pets&#34; the animal during sleep transitions to sooth herself to sleep<br />-Lays flat on baby's chest, keeping it in their mouth even when they are newborn and don't have great &#34;suction&#34; yet<br />-Many different stuffed animal options and they are all so cute<br />-difficult to lose because of the size (they don't fall out and disappear under the couch!)<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Difficult to wash just the pacifier<br />-Wish the pacifier was detachable so that it could be swapped out for the different stages<br /><br />Overall, our baby has loved this pacifier from day one. We don't have many complaints and I love that we get so many compliments on how cute it is!",1/31/2014

Our daughter started with the Soothie and seemed to have a preference for that initially. She did later take this paci as well, however with both this and the Soothie, she kept spitting it out. I initially wanted to use these so as to eliminate the possibility of nipple confusion - however we soon realized that wasn't a big deal as she was doing great nursing.  We bought some of the Avent infant pacifiers and she loved those. They have a small 'bulb' shape at the end - so as she's sucking, she's keeping it in her mouth.  We had no problems with those being spit out.  I've seen a few babies successfully use and keep these style pacifiers in, but most I've talked to start with these and then soon move on to the Avent pacifiers.  While it is well made and a great style (I like that it's not the big green circle in her face), I probably wouldn't have needed to buy these.",1/31/2014

I loved that they were one piece (easier to clean), silicone, and orthodontic. I went on a pacifier hunt for several months until I finally found these! These are the almost-perfect replacements. All other pacifiers in our house have been tossed.<br /><br />Here's what we like:<br /> - The nipple has an orthodontic shape that my son doesn't spit out (which to me means it's a good fit). It also has a bit of give so the nipple can be sucked in a little harder if wanted; occasionally my son will play with that feature. I assume it simulates the flex of mom's nipple. Also, the narrow part of the nipple (between the lips/gums) is slightly textured. This also helps the pacifier stay in baby's mouth.<br /> - Although these pacifiers are not one solid piece, the silicone part is very wide and covers the whole mouth area. If you've ever used a pacifier where the mouthpiece connects directly to the plastic shield, you've likely seen just how nasty they can get at the connecting area- where you can't clean it!<br /> - The solid vertical 'bar' on the shield is great. It doesn't stick out so far that it gets knocked out, yet it's easy for my son to grab it to pull it out and put it back in. You can also use a pacifier holder there (like the BooginHead PaciGrip).<br /> - The mouth shield has just enough dip under the nose and curve to the cheeks to fit nicely without digging in anywhere. My son has big cheeks and some pacifiers dig in on the sides; this one doesn't.<br /><br />Ultimately any pacifier that stays in and can be thoroughly cleaned is a huge WIN! in my book. My son is 12 months and the 6+ months size is still great for him. It probably would've been a little too big right at the 6 month mark but babies grow fast.<br /><br />The negative reviews here are due to the colors may vary lack of color choice- not due to the pacifier itself. Yes I wish amazon let us choose- but sometimes you just don't have that option, and you as a consumer take a chance that you may not love the colors. Deal with it!! We've bought 5 packs over a couple of months and received: 3 red/blue, 1 green/teal, and 1 pink/purple. I'll likely save the pink/purple for a gift- or in case or pacifier emergency!",1/11/2014

With the small animal attached to the pacifier it made it easy for her to search for it in the middle of the night without the assitance of my husband or I.  Then around the age of 2, the pacifier actually broke off of the stuffed animal due to wear & tear (my kid would hold onto the pacifier with her teeth and pull it out of her mouth constantly).

Regular pacifiers fall out when the baby starts sucking on it and starts to pop it up and down in their mouth.  Very frustrating to keep putting back in their mouth especially while you're trying to get them to sleep.<br /><br />With the wubbanub monkey pacifier, you can spread out it's legs so the pacifier stays in her mouth as she pops it in and out.  The head weighs it down just enough to keep it in.  The position of the pacifier sewed into the monkey's mouth is a good angle to help it stay in.  I heard from friends that some of the other animals are not as good as the monkey for the angle.  The monkey is small and light enough that when she's turning her head back and forth (fighting to not go to sleep) and it gets on her face, she can still breathe just fine.<br /><br />I tried the pacifier clip before purchasing the monkey. The clip works well to keep it from dropping on the floor, but doesn't help with keeping it in her mouth.<br /><br />FYI: this does not keep it in her mouth all the time.  At times, she likes to grab it, yank it out, and sometimes toss it.  But it works well most of the time.  I'd buy it again.<br /><br />She's now almost 4 months old and has been able to grab it and get it into her mouth a few times.  She also loves to suck on it's legs and tail now that she's a little older.  So we only need one item to go out instead of a toy and pacifier.<br /><br />Other sleep suggestions:  From birth to about 2 months old, she just wasn't sleeping well at all, she constantly woke herself up when her arms would suddenly move - it startled her.  So with much trial and error, I found the solution to my baby sleeping all night: this swaddle sleepsack (her arms stopped waking her up), her monkey wubbanub pacifier (monkey keeps it in her mouth as she pops it in and out (most of the time), munchkin nursery projector/sound machine turned to heartbeat & projector, mattress at a slight angle (seemed to reduce reflux) = baby sleeping all night 6-10 hrs!!!!

The attached animal really keeps you from losing it.  A bit pricey, but too cute to pass up.  Babies love to hold on to the stuff animal, and it helps with propping it up so the soothie doesn't always pop right out when they stop sucking.  My daughter was out of the pacifier stage by 4 months old, so it hasn't been used since.<br /><br />I love it, but I give it 4 stars because the pacifier can't be interchanged (it's sewn onto the product) and it can't go through the washing machine, which means you have to buy a new one if you want to use it long-term.  My friend's son has had his monkey one for over a year, and I believe she does put it through the washer.  It might be worth trying, but I didn't want to risk ruining it.",12/6/2013

I had gotten this when my daughter was 3 months old and it is so nice that when she starts fussing, the pacifier doesn't fall out of her mouth completely.  She's holding on to mr toutou, so once she's done fussing, she just sucks on the pacifier without me needing to put it back in her mouth.  This is also great for car rides.  When she wakes up in the car, he's right there for her.  No need to scream or have mommy reach back to find a pacifier and put it in! She's almost 5 months now and after seeing how well it worked, I bought a backup- Elliot the elephant, a replacement pacifier and the soft teethers that attach (not a necessity yet, but she still enjoys the textures).  Everything is high quality.  I would recommend this over the other brands that don't detach from the stuffed animal because the pacifier part needs to be washed off a lot in our pet friendly home and I think its gross to put a pacifier in the washer/dryer.  It would get nicks and cracks in it much easier and common sense says that's where bacteria likes to live.  The pacifier itself is very similar to our advent soothie pacifier and I never worry about it being pulled off the stuffed animal by her- it's secured by three round nubbins that push in to a soft plastic on the dogs head.  Even if it did fall off, it's the same exact size as her soothie.  I really recommend this product and will be ordering one for each and every baby shower I attend!",12/3/2013

Good luck if you kick it with a toe while your baby is in your arms. It will find a way across the room to the point of no return until you put the baby down and turn all the lights on (maybe). Do they make glow-in-the-dark pacifier clips?

Not only are they made of natural materials (better for the environment and less likely to have toxins), they are adorable on...think Maggie Simpson ;)<br /><br />You do need to heed the manufacturer's recommendation and replace every few weeks (like you would a toothbrush) cause they kinda flatten out and become tacky.

I'd read a lot about Wubbanubs and Soothies (the pacifier brand attached to the Wubbanubs) being a great option for holding.<br /><br />LOVE Wubbanubs! Took a few days/weeks for little one to warm up to using a pacifier but she loves her Wubbanubs. I bought the tabby kitty to keep in her crib and we use the ducky for going out. The necks are easy to use a snap-on pacifier holder ( a friend had gotten us one from Etsy with a thick hairband on the end). They're super easy to grasp for little one. It was the first thing she learned to really grab well and to pull back into her mouth.<br /><br />They sit so well on her chest. I like the kitten over the ducky for this reason-  it's a bit wider so it sits really well. And I just realized I can (LOOSELY) tuck it into her swaddle so that it's easy to find again. I just did it for the first time and little one has been starting to go through a sleep regression and she just woke up, found it, and went back to sleep! Holy crap. Why didn't I try this sooner?!<br /><br />Anyways, I've tried regular pacifiers (even Soothies) since and she spits them right out. She liked to hold on to the little stuffed guys. I definitely recommend and I think I'm going to start getting them for baby shower presents, since you probably can't have too many.<br /><br />I will say, I wish I could take off the paci to boil but I wash it with hot water and soap every once in a while and throw it through the wash occasionally (especially the one we take out of the house). And I have stuck the tip into a boiling pot of water before too really quickly but watch you don't burn yourself with the steam.",10/31/2013

The hospital gave him several of these pacifiers during our stay even though they suggested not to use pacifiers at all since I planned to breastfeed which to me was just not possible since he needed something to comfort him while he was not eating. I continued to use and bought more in many different colors until I realized the part that sticks out is dangerous. The pacifier stabbed him in the eye when it fell out his mouth and he rolled over while playing. If you plan to use please understand supervising your child at all times still leaves possibility for injury because they move quickly and anything can happen in a split second.

So if your baby is not used to this type of pacifier, they might Not like this one.  It is Permanently attached to the stuffed animal, it does not detach for cleaning!  The stuffed animal is lightweight, stuffed with cotton. I like the Wubbanub because it is Easy to Find, no more going crazy trying to find the small pacifier!  Even very young infants can grasp at the animal pacifier, it is amazing to watch them, holding onto the  Wubbanub, thusly holding onto the pacifier!  Somehow it keeps the pacifier in babys mouth, especially while baby is lying down.  At night it is invaluable for a parents good nights sleep; if your baby loves the pacifier!  I've found the perfect way to keep the pacifier clean, just buy the pacifier wipes and use them to keep it clean and sanitized. This Giraffe is Loved so much that one  stays home and  one is even kept in the diaper bag, heaven forbid we loose one!  I really like the Giraffe because it is so easy for little hands to hold onto so many of the little legs. This Wubbanub should be looked over occasionally, just to make sure there are no holes or stuffing coming out, this is Not a Teething Toy!, remember it is, just a pacifier with an attached stuffed animal!<br />.",10/11/2013

Anyway, all that changed 3 days after she was born and was screaming non-stop. My mother-in-law sat me down and said &#34;now I know you don't want to use pacifiers but babies need to suck and if you don't want to breastfeed non-stop they'll help... plus they use them in the neo-natal unit at Stanford Hospital so how bad can they be?&#34;<br /><br />At my wit's end and in tears I begged her to get some for me. She returned with 3 kinds (not these, because they're not for newborns). My daughter liked the soft Nuk ones the best, but when she turned 6 months old they were too small for her so I took myself off to the store to find the same, but larger. They don't exist, so flexing my super scientific muscle I endeavored to pick the one that was closest. These were them. The colored bit is hard plastic to keep the shape, but that piece is completely covered in soft silicone. It took my daughter about a day to get used to them and the work wonders for calming her.<br /><br />You set so many rules for yourself as a parent, always with the best of intentions, but you have to be ready to flex and this is one I'm glad we broke. Nap times and I-hate-my-carseat-and-just-want-to-scream times are much easier with these.  We're about to wean her off them, but am so glad we found them when our other ones got too small.",9/19/2013

It may look a little expensive for a thermometer, but it's a good price if you consider the peace of mind the can bring to your life, especially at night when you have a sick infant or toddler having fever episodes due to a virus or other reason. When after struggling to give them some medicine and help to go to sleep, They finally feel better and go to sleep, the last thing you want to do is to wake them up by trying to check on theirs temperature. When my 1 year old daughter was sick with flu like symptons, including fever, it was a big relief for me and my wife knowing that we could just get close to her and check her temperature without touching her body; that made a world of a difference. We compared this thermometer we many others we have and find it to be as accurate as any good conventional thermometer could be.

Truth is, my six-week-old just isn't the pacifier-loving kid my first born was. So, I suppose it would have been good to try two years ago! I would suggest trying this one though (I'm a dental assistant, and would recommend you ALWAYS try the orthodontic pacifier before you pop the soothie in your infants' mouth). $9 or$10 is a small price to pay to avoid thousands of dollars in orthodontic bills in their teenage years!

Unfortunately, we didn't introduce them until 18 months and switching so late in the game was not going to happen. I wish I had known about them earlier.  The price is a little crazy but if it saves you the orthodontic costs later in life I guess it is not so expensive after all :)<br /><br />My almost 2-year old has had a pacifier addiction since birth. Since around 12 months she has only been using one for sleep.  She prefers the Soothies to the exclusion of all others. Since she had begun teething, she was chewing on them and biting small holes in the newborn Soothies that she preferred (0-3 month) and we had to replace them almost every day.  So, we started buying the stiffer 3+ month Soothies.<br /><br />At her 18-month pedi appointment he noted that her teeth were developing crookedly.  I had noticed this myself so was not surprised with the report.  He suggested switching to the orthodontic kind. We bought binky after binky hoping she would give one a chance. The clear silicone ones were not going to happen.  She would look at them, yell at me, and throw them on the floor.<br /><br />Fast forward a few days:  I saw these online, the price was steep but it was the opaque type of material sort of similar to the Soothie so I bought two sizes 0-6 months and the 6+ months (she prefers the size and texture of the newborn pacis).  She put it in her mouth for a few seconds and spit it out.  Then she refused to take it again.<br /><br />We now give her the 0-3 month Soothies again(luckily she stopped biting through them after a couple of weeks of intense teething).  They are much less stiff than the 3+ month Soothies and her teeth are looking better but not perfect.  I do think the stiffness was a big part of the problem.<br /><br />Although I am sure that other parents would disagree, taking away the binky is not an option in my mind due to her level of attachment.  So, I put it into perspective:  there are way worse things than crooked teeth.  As the pedi said, this is crooked teeth, not cancer.  Enough said.n option in my mind due to her level of attachment.

We also didn’t want to put her in the crib with anything with straps/clips on it to avoid various hazards there.  Then we found the wubbanub and it has exceeded our expectations.  With the wubbanub she can find and grab the body without our intervention and she loves the characters.  We have the giraffe and frog and she loves looking at the faces and then puts the pacifier, head or one of the legs in her mouth (sometimes all at the same time).  We wash it regularly and don't leave the house without it.  We have lots of cute photos too with an animal hanging out of her mouth :-)  Only improvement would be to offer a version with replaceable binkies or at least an option for the 3+ month stronger plastic.

We have a little duck wubbanub too, but the horns on the giraffe and the weight of the feet just make it perfect somehow....Whoever invented these is genius.

He became attached to the Soothie brand pacifier we were given at the hospital. When he was around 2 months, we began the battle of him losing his pacifier in the night and I was constantly waking up to put it back in his mouth. I had been skeptical about trying a Wubbanub because I was afraid he would form an attachment to it since it's a toy and a Soothie in one and that it would be hard to break him of it. In a state of sleep deprivation, I picked this one up and am so glad I did!<br /><br />When he was still small, I swaddled this up with him and night so that he didn't lose it. Did it make him sleep through the night? No. But at least I wasn't constantly retrieving a pacifier. As he got older, he learned to hold it himself and guide it back in his mouth. The longhorn attached made it easier for his immature eye-hand coordination than if it was just the pacifier. Now that he's 8 months old, he chews on the horns, sucks on the tag, and chews on the pacifier. I don't have bumper pads in his crib, so other pacifiers fall through the rail. This Wubbanub stays in the crib much better than those do.<br /><br />I've read reviews that say it's cheaply made or not easily washable and I do not agree. About once a week I round up all the pacifiers and boil them. I just hold the nipple of this into the boiling water to keep the longhorn dry. Rather than throwing it in the washing machine with clothes when the longhorn gets dirty (and it does a lot because it goes everywhere with us), I just hand wash it with some Dreft and let it air dry. This keep it from getting fuzzy, as other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />I had actually gotten on here to order a second one because we like it so much and I'm afraid we'll lose the one we have. My fear came true that this has become his lovey, but I plan to just cut the pacifier off when the time comesto wean off of it. I still wish he didn't use a pacifier, but I'm so happy that we found something he likes and is capable of using all on his own!<br /><br />UPDATED JULY 2013<br /><br />I still fully stand behind this product, but wanted to update that we did have our first big issue with this Wubbanub. At 10 months, my son is a terror when it comes to teething. He bites and chews very hard on anything available, including this pacifier. On the one he's been using for 6 months, he was finally able to rip the pacifier part off of the longhorn by chomping down on the pacifier and pulling on the plush part over and over for weeks. It came off in one piece and wasn't a choking hazard, but it's thoroughly confused my son! I think part of the problem is that these are made with Soothies for ages 0-6 months, which has thinner material in the pacifier. If I had a way to attach a 6+ month paci to this, it would probably fare much better. Still a great product, but keep an eye out for your little chompers and make sure that the material is still holding firm.",5/14/2013

WubbaNub should win a prize, for most awesome baby product for PARENTS!  Why parents? Because you finally do not have to get up every 2 min to put the soothie back in after your baby spits it up!<br /><br />My baby played a game called stupid soothie and mommy, where she would suck the soothie until mommy got back in bed, waited 2 min for mommy to get comfy, and BAM, spit it out, or with the help of her tiny long fingers, hurl the soothie right out of the crib.  I swear I would get up at least 20 times with each time I put her in the crib.  I was growing so frustrated.  Then while reading some forum, I kept seeing references to Wubbanub, due to the odd name, I looked it up, and it was like a bright light had shined on me!  I was saved!  I ordered one immediately, and life has been a bliss ever since!  My baby would also go into crying spells in the car, when I drove and the soothie fell out, and I had no way of getting it back into babies mouth asap.  The Wubbanub has stopped all of this drama.  The bear design in particular works better than some others, the month of the bear is bigger and holds the soothie down and in the mouth.  We also have the giraffe, and while cute, the mouth of giraffe where soothie is connected is thin and longer, and the soothie doesn't stay in quite as well as with the bear.<br /><br />Additional tip: if you put a blanket on top of the bear, it stays in even better, less risk of slipping out.  Also, after the initial wash/soothie boil, instead of boiling everyday and getting half the bear wet, I bought pacifier wipes that work well to get all the grime/germs off.<br /><br />This has seriously been a life saver!",4/21/2013

Having a video feed, in addition to the audio, is wonderful.  This monitor does an adequate job of displaying a good angle of the room and is pretty clear even in the near dark.  In my opinion, the video doesn't have to be high definition, but simply good enough to give an idea of what your kid is doing.  This monitor does the job, and does it well.<br /><br />2. After about 11 months of use, the monitor would not take a charge.  Playing around with it, I determined that the wall charger was fine, but the battery would not recharge, or continue to work even when plugged in.  Even though we may have been out of warranty (we received the monitor as a gift well before the twins arrived), I called Motorola and they agreed to replace the monitor for free.  Much more than I expected from customer service.  So although it failed, Motorola was responsive and took care of the problem.  Since then, we haven't had any problems.<br /><br />3. The user interface isn't perfect.  For example, we have twins and purchased an extra camera for a second room.  While we love the ability to add extra cameras, and the possibility of setting the monitor to automatically cycle through the cameras, for some reason you cannot change the video feed while the volume or brightness control is on the display.  And there is a huge lag in the time it takes for the volume control to clear the screen after you hit the button.  Often, we'll hear one kid crying, pick up the monitor and turn up the sound, and then have to wait several seconds for that to clear before changing to a different video feed.  While this may seem like user error, or a small inconvenience, I'll be the first to admit that we aren't always thinking clearly at 2 a.m., which also happens to be the time when I have the least patience for the volume control to clear so I can change feeds.  This isn't a deal breaker, but it keeps me from giving it five stars.<br /><br />4.  It has additional features, like the ability to play music and speak through a microphone to the camera.  I've never used these other than to make my wife jump when she is putting away the kids' laundry.  It doesn't detract from the product, but seems unnecessary to me.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like the best monitor for the price.  Although I won't say it's perfect, I am happy we chose the MBP33 and have no regrets.'t a deal breaker, but it keeps me from giving it five stars.<br /><br />4.

As they get older, the stuffed animal serves as a comfort toy, full of texture and appendages to pull. Sometimes baby sucks and chews on everything but the pacifier! They also are easy to wash. We wash the pacifier in the sink, keeping the plush out of the water for quick cleans. Then, when a deep clean is needed (after all that chewing) we wash the whole thing in a delicate laundry bag in the washing machine with her baby clothes.

US,17884615,R31ZXFAS0W6GQ1,B00BIFACT0,955350284,dr. brown's prevent classic pacifier,Baby,5,9,9,N,Best pacifier choice out there!,"LOVE these pacifiers!  We bought small packs of three different types of pacifiers to see what our baby would prefer.  We bought Dr Brown's Prevent, Nuk, and Avent.  Our baby will LOVES the Dr Brown pacifiers.  She'll put up with the Avent ones, but they pop out of her mouth so easily it's hardly worth it.  The Nuk ones get spit out almost instantly, they're too hard to keep in her mouth.  These ones have a fantastic shape that is very well designed.  I love that it doesn't give her gas because she's not sucking any air.  These are just so perfectly designed and we've already bought more for her.  I think it's good advice to try different pacifiers for your baby because all babies are different, but I will say that these ones definitely stay in their mouths better no matter who your baby is - so I won't tell you not to try different pacifiers at first, but definitely include these when you're trying a few out!  They'll probably become a quick favorite for you and baby.<br /><br />Originally we purchased the Dr Browns Prevent pacifiers from another Amazon listing where Colors may vary and there are no handles on the pacifier.  We ended up with blue and red, which I didn't love for our little girl.  It's silly and not important, but I didn't love having her suck on a blue or red pacifier when she was always dressed in pink or purple.  These pacifiers are much preferred!  Though they're the same shape for sucking, there are a few differences.  The silly difference (but it matters to me!) of the color is the obvious difference.  Another key difference is these ones also have the handles on them and the others don't.  I have found that I much prefer the handles for multiple reasons.  One, they are easy to hold if I'm burping her and just want to have the pacifier handy for when she's done and ready for it.  Two, if I drop the pacifier, the extra weight from the handle makes it land on the back almost every time so the nipple doesn't get dirty.  Three, if you're attaching a pacifier clip, it can attach to the handle instead of the opening on the part of the pacifier that touches the baby's face.  Our pacifier clip was always rubbing against our baby's face when using the other ones and I didn't like that since it left a red mark on her cheek.<br />Another difference is that these pacifiers actually come with a clip-on nipple cover.  I LOVE this accessory because if I'm running to a neighbor's house for a short visit and I don't need to tote a whole diaper bag, but I do want to bring a pacifier - I easily can with the clip cover.  It works so great to just clip the cover on so I can throw the pacifier in my pocket without it getting all nasty.  Or it's nice for putting in the diaper bag without getting gross as well.<br /><br />The price is about the same (within a dollar) of the other colors may vary listing, so these ones are the clear winner between the two listings.  If you want a great pacifier for your little girl, these are PERFECT!",4/9/2013

And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it.<br /><br />However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item:<br />- I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer.<br />- The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do.<br />- I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great!<br /><br />Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby. I also bought one for my godson and he loves his so much, too, but his mom has the exact same issues than I do. Anyhow, I don't regret my purchase but hope that Wubbanub will make this product better before I have another baby...",3/23/2013

These are wipes that you can use to clean pacifiers, sippy cups, bottle nipples, teethers, or whatever if they happen to fall on the ground (or get thrown...) and you are nowhere near a source of water or soap and can rinse things. They come in a convenient little package, they are disposable, and fit into a diaper bag along with the several other different types of wipes a mom must carry around with her.<br /><br />I purchased these initially from Amazon once, because I had never seen them in stores. Immediately after receiving them in the mail I noticed them in stores, for a significantly lower price than what I had paid. So I stopped buying them on here. I also now prefer [[ASIN:B004HM368U Munchkin 36 Pack Arm and Hammer Pacifier Wipes, White]] instead of the First Years ones.<br /><br />First of all, these are indeed wonderful for when you are not near soap and water and can't rinse things off. But for most people, that is not really often enough to justify the purchase of the wipes or having to carry them around with everything else crammed into a diaper bag. In most situations where I couldn't rinse off something in a sink I didn't have these wipes, I usually had a bottle of water I could pour over the item to rinse it. That's not to say that these aren't useful if maybe you are on a long road trip with few rest areas where you can buy water or rinse things in a bathroom sink, or if you are camping, or if your baby is screaming in the middle of the store and you need to sanitize her pacifier quickly and don't have time to dash to the restroom to use the soap and water. In such cases, these are very useful. But its not an everyday occurrence and something to think about before stocking up on multiple packs.<br /><br />There is the issue with the chemicals and the possible residue. That is why I like the Munchkin brand better now, because these left a sort of oily feeling residue and the Munchkin ones left none. But I do prefer an oily residue over possible bacteria or fungus that might have otherwise been on the item. They have an odd scent which I think is some sort of sugary flavor left on the cup or toy or whatever so the baby doesn't taste the cleaning chemicals. I'm not sure if that bothers me or not, as it is probably a necessary evil. Unfortunately it seems that my daughter didn't like the taste because after using the wipes she never wanted her pacifier, and made a disgusted face when pulling it out of her mouth. She stopped using her pacifier at 3 months. So maybe use these to wipe your pacis down when you are trying to wean your child off them.<br /><br />All things considered, these are pretty good for situations when there is no soap and water, but these are definitely not a replacement for soap and water.an oily residue over possible bacteria or fungus that might have otherwise been on the item.

I decided to give this one a try, hoping that maybe if the paci fell out, it would still stay close enough for her to get back in her mouth on her own.  No such luck.  Also, when she starts vigorously sucking, she gets all excited and starts to pull on the animal, causing the paci to come out.  My sister had one of these with her DS a couple years ago, but I remember the animal being a little more weighted than this pink bear... per another reviewer, perhaps the quality has changed a bit over the years?<br /><br />The nice things about this paci is that it's cute as heck.  Also, when the paci does fall out of her mouth, it doesn't go too far - a problem I had with the paci alone falling on the floor and then me needing a few backups on hand in case I couldn't wash it right away.  I think this would be great for on the go - less likely for this bigger thing to fall out of the carseat (I don't think I quite trust a paci leash with my DD being this little).<br /><br />The one thing I don't like about this is that you can't remove the paci from the animal, so it makes washing a little tricky.  I'm used to having to sterilize everything daily for a preemie and this one you can't really throw in the dishwasher or in the steam basket.  The only way to sterilize is to dip it in boiling water and trying not to get the animal wet.  Based on reviews, doesn't sound like a good idea to throw this guy in the washing machine.  Plus, I'm not sure if I would want my DD's paci in the washing machine anyways.<br /><br />I am hoping as she gets a little bigger and if we decide to stick with a paci, that this will work out better for us.

It's our go-to car seat pacifier.  It sits on her chest well, making it easier for her to recover after spitting it out accidentally and making it less likely to fall on the floor.  The elephant gives me something to easily grab from the drivers seat while reaching back as she cries on her way home from daycare.  Suprisingly, it also helped in her development of learning how to reach/grab and becoming more coordinated.  She's now four months old and still loves this Soothie pacifier, although she also uses MAM pacifiers in the house.  I held out for a couple months, but just gave in and purchased another WubbaNub last week.<br /><br />It would be wonderful if the pacifier could be separated from the animal for easier cleaning, but this doesn't deter me from recommending it to all of my friends.",2/8/2013

He was a little tongue-tied and it still didn't affect his sucking on these.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the edges if you play with them a lot you can start to feel the silicone breaking and letting the plastic piece that creates the shape poke out a bit.

After a couple of duds, we found this.  It's great! My daughter is 18 months and still uses the small rounded size.<br /><br />First and foremost, it had to be safe.  And this is, in many different ways.  Made from natural rubber and oils, I am not concerned about contaminating plastics.  The shape is awesome; it cleans up easily and has no cracks for bacteria to hide when cleaning and sterilizing.  When it first comes out of the box, it is oily.  As others have mentioned, after you wash for the first time, instructions say to boil for a few minutes.  Let it cool and you'll see the oils have been tamed.<br /><br />My daughter loves this paci.  We once ran out of them after I noticed a crack on the side of the nipple (my fault - I let it go much longer than the recommended 6 weeks between replacement).  That was a very long a night.  I tried a few chemical laden replacements until I could get a new shipment in to no avail.<br /><br />All that being said, these are expensive.  And the cost doubles when you realize that you are supposed to replace them every 6 weeks or so.  Much longer than that and the pacifiers start to harden.

Keeps binky in the crib and is easy to find.,"Not only are these incredibly cute, but it is fantastic for those times when binky pops out of the mouth in the middle of the night and baby wakes up and needs to find it.

This one is easy to find in the crib and it won't fall out of the crib!! This is essential to parents' sanity and sleep!! We get tons of comments on this because it's so cute and unusual. I've even washed this in the washing machine (air dry) and it didn't fall apart. After probably a year of solid use, the binky part did eventually come off of the elephant, but I re-attached it with a safety pin and it's still being used.

My recommendation is to use this early on but try to get your child to use a different pacifier during the day before they get too used to it. Our daughter only uses a pacifier for naps and at night but if she needs one during the day we're trying to get her to use a standard pacifier.

It fits very nicely, with no gaps, but I was a little put off by the material.  We have a firm crib mattress from Da Vinci at home, and this mattress seemed much more firm.  It's also covered in plastic, not fabric; although it's nice not to need a waterproof mattress pad, it winds up being very noisy if your baby moves, rustling the sheet against the plastic.  I would have preferred a fabric cover, and either buying a waterproof pad myself if I was using the mattress a lot, or just forgoing it and risking ruining the mattress, since it's fairly inexpensive and we were only using it for a short time.<br /><br />I know these aren't huge issues, but the bottom line is that my baby did not sleep well on it, and since we were in the same room, neither did we.  She adjusted quickly to the new surroundings and napped just fine in her usual Rock 'n Play, so I don't think it was just the fact that we were traveling.  She fidgeted the entire night (which kept us up all night with the rustling on the plastic!) and woke up much more frequently.  It was, however, an improvement over the 'mattress' that comes with the Pack 'n Play, and for the price, I am glad that we purchased it.

I realized that the reason she did not take to the new one at first was because it did not smell familar to her.Now she loves it as much as her monkey and I can wash the other one finally...as she will not do without one :) It is PERFECT in every way,it's a pacifier and her lovey/security,she will only take the pacifier when she's sleepy but she will grasp the legs and hold on tight and cuddle with it.BEST OF ALL: I don't have to dig for a paci EVER!It is so easy to find any time any where.She has a hard time holding one in her mouth(preemie) and this helps her to keep it there and when she does not want it she can just move her head and it falls out/away but stays with her.These are very durable.One of my baby shower gifts from now on.<br />Suggestion on washing:I take a mesh bag(zipped) or pillowcase(tied at the end) and drop the Wubbanub in and throw it in the washing machine on gentle cycle,let it air dry then wash the pacifier with warm/hot soapy water or use a pacifier wipe and we are good to go.<br />I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM OR ANY WUBBANUB :)",11/9/2012

We had, as new parents, gone out an bought what we thought were great pacifiers (Tommee Tippee).  We quickly learned that what you think you will like vs. what you actually use is sometimes quite different.  I'm not sure if it was because she was born small, (roughly 5.5 lbs,) or because she just likes the feel, but our daughter refuses the TT pacis and instead prefers these alone. The nipple is more similar to a breast, and to a baby who is exclusively breastfed, I would imagine that it is more soothing. We ended up buying more of the Hawaii Medical Gumdrops because they are awesome.  They have a great one-piece design and a little handle that allows you to manipulate the pacifier in you little one's mouth.  I would highly recommend these to any parent.",10/29/2012

As a plastics engineer, even though many pacifiers are bpa-free I prefer the natural rubber for my child.<br /><br />My child started using a Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier at 3 weeks but was not a big pacifier fan until trying Avent Soothie at 4 weeks. Luckily we had received several as shower gifts. However the course of the next 8 weeks we managed to lose 3!  I also had read about replacing pacis at 6-8 weeks. I would agree with this when they're teething or if they reuse the same one frequently. But if you have enough to rotate than its bit necessary.<br /><br />I ordered these due to low Soothie supply & the age cap of 3 months. I like that these can go to 6 months instead.

She is just barely coordinated to get her paci back in about 1/3 of the time (that I see, although she probably finds it sometimes and I don't even know).  Since she has figured out how to roll over, she only sleeps on her belly.  Mam pacifiers are great for belly sleepers because they have a low profile and don't get knocked out of baby's mouth when she turns her head, and they are super light so they stay in easily.  I have sprinkled like 6 pacis around her head at night to increase the odds that she'll find one.  Until now, she had been using the under six month size, but I wanted to get the 6+ size to see what the difference is.  The shield is a bit larger and so is the nipple, and the nipple is more bulbous at the end.  I haven't noticed that she has an easier or harder time keeping them in than the smaller size.  She seems to not care which size I give her.  The glowing is genius.  Only the knob glows, not the shield or nipple, so the glowing part doesn't touch her face.  Makes it a snap for me to find in the night, and I'm hopeful that it helps her find them more often, too!  I held them under the light for like 10 seconds before I put her down, and they were much dimmer but still glowing 12 hours later.",10/13/2012

With our first child we used traditional pacifiers and we were constantly having to put it back in our child's mouth when it would fall out. But not the Wubba! This toy/pacifier is ingenious! It cuts down the need to replace it in the child's mouth drastically. If baby is sleeping with their head tilted to the side you can gently position Wubba so it is a prop up to hold the pacifier in baby's mouth. When baby is on their back looking up at the ceiling you place wubba on their chest and even if their little mouth relaxes and falls open during sleep, Wubba holds the pacifier gentaly in place so when baby seeks it -it is there! Before you know it little one will be holding on to it (great for helping to develop dexterity) and its too cute! We used to joke about how we wished there was a type of pacifier headgear...

This thing is too cute, the nipple is too large for a new born but should be usable after about 6-9 months. There is no ring or ledge for removal from a baby's mouth or to attach a pacy clip to. This shouldn't be a big deal because this should probably only be used under CLOSE supervision due to the nipple size, weight and materials used. Let's face it, though it can be used by a child it doesn't look like usability was the main goal when making this. Laughter was. It's built well and will work.

I gave him one as he was getting ready to head down for his next nap.  It took a little work to get him to hang onto it, as he's been used to more traditionally shaped pacifiers (he's 11 weeks old), but he caught on fairly fast, and the next time he went to nurse I noticed that he was taking a deeper latch already!  I had some supply problems early on, so anything that encourages good latching and better milk transfer is okay by me.    I've noticed some reviews criticizing this pacifier for being a potential choking hazard.  Let me say that there is a degree of personal responsibility here.  These are not the hard plastic pacifiers most people are used to... they are medical grade silicone, made for newborns.  The whole thing is softer, more flexible, and yes, that means that you have to watch your baby to make sure he can't fit the whole thing into his mouth, because babies try that.  On the wrapper it says not to leave your baby alone with a pacifier (any pacifier), and I imagine that it's for precisely this reason.  If your child can fit the whole Soothie into his/her mouth, it's too small and you need to buy a binky that is appropriately sized for your child.    As for the suckerfish look... I think it's hilariously cute.    Update 2/19/12 - Still loving the Soothie, still refusing any and all other binkies.  Longer review on my blog:    [...]",2/6/2012

I live in Singapore and it took a while for the package to reach me and in the interim managed to find a more traditional style pacifier from Pidgeon but  with an olive shaped teat.  It's possible I would think more highly of the soothie if I had not tried the Pigeon pacifier first.  My baby  will take the soothie but does not prefer it over the pigeon one.  The problem with the Soothie is that it falls out of his mouth really easy.  If he lets up sucking for a moment it falls out of his mouth.  If it happens to roll out of his cot (which seems to happen more frequently than a regular pacifier) it always lands teat side down (regular pacifiers are more likely to land teat side up).  Additionally there is no cover for the soothie and it is more difficult to teather to a stroller or car seat so it is not a great pacifier to travel with.  In short:  I will use the soothies as back-ups as baby will take them but will not be buying more as a regular pacifier with an olive shaped teat is better,2/2/2012

I came to amazon.com upon learning the name of them and I found a TON more than the duck and red puppy. I let my oldest daughter pick out my youngest daughters Wubbanub and she found this. I love how soft the elephant is. I was also very happy that for the first time in her two months of being on Earth she decided she didn't need the vanilla scent of her soothies from the hospital. We will now be ordering her the Red Dragon, as that was the one my husband wanted to get her.  I only gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because of the way it has to be cleaned, and the binkies are not interchangeable if the soothie gets worn down.

It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it.

The little lamb (and it is little) is precious and you can't help but say awww when you first see it.  It's a great concept, and any parent that has played the retrieve the binky game is hoping it will work.  So far for us it's been about 50% successful.  The little lamb's feet are slightly weighted, so if our daughter is lying still in her rumble chair and you get the binky in her mouth and the lamb spread out right it does work.  The problem is at 11 weeks she's not exactly lying still all that often but she doesn't have the hand control to hold on to the lamb.  She still has the whole arms-swinging-wildly startle reflex going, so more often than not she knocks the lamb, which pops the binky out of her mouth, defeating the whole purpose.  She can't control her hands enough yet to then get it back in.<br /><br />On the upside, it does prevent the binky from rolling off onto the floor and it makes it much easier to find and put back in her mouth.  I can see the potential for this product and hope when she gets older and can actually hold on to the lamb it will work.  I'm giving it a 3 star rating for now for cuteness and potential and hope to upgrade to a 4 or 5 star rating in the future.<br /><br />Update: A year later and I'm afraid this little lamb never really worked out for us.  By the time my daughter had enough hand control to no knock the lamb out she was keeping a binky in her mouth more readily and she would grab this little guy to examine and again, pull the binky out of her mouth.  We ended up using binky leashes, which were perfect for our needs.  She recently rediscovered this little guy, and while she's too big to need him, she did enjoy popping the binky in and out of her mouth a few times holding the lamb, but then became angry that the lamb wouldn't give up his prize. =)  At this point, this guy is holding on to one star from us for sheer cuteness and one for what COULD be a great idea for another child, but I'm afraid he never quite worked out for us.  (We have friends who swear by him however, so it may work for your child.)<br /><br />As a note: it would be nice if there was some way to attach and detach the binky.  If she had used this frequently I could see it getting dirty and needing to be washed, which would be tricky without getting laundry detergent on the binky.  On the reverse side, you would want to wash the binky with dish soap but not the lamb.  The only decent solution is to handwash, and what busy parent has time for that?  (Plus at my daughter's current age I could see her loving to carry this little guy around if she could get the binky out of his mouth and it would have been nice to have given the toy a second life.)",12/31/2011

Once she knew she could do it, bedtime became a nightmare.  I didn't think she was mature enough to stay in a toddler bed.  And I was having a terrible time sleeping myself worrying that she would get out of her crib and would have free rein in the house.  I was concerned by some of the reviews saying it was poorly constructed, but I was desperate.  I have to say I love it!  My daughter things it's great when I put her in it, she'll even lift the flap for me to zip it sometimes.  She fusses when it's time to lay down.  But that's the same with the tent or without.  She seems to fall asleep more quickly with the tent.  I'm guessing that's partly because she can't throw her comfort items (blanket, lovey and seahorse) out, and partly because she knows she really doesn't have another option.  Instead of trying to get out of the crib, she just lays down.  I will agree the instructions could be better.  It took me longer than I would have liked to put it together. As for those with the zipper troubles, I almost wonder if they had the velcro too tight.  I know the first couple of times I zipped and unzipped it, I was really concerned. (It was like zipping up luggage that was too full.) But when I loosened the velcro holding it to the front rail, the zipper action was much smoother.  I have only had it for 6 weeks.  So I can not speak to it's long term durability.  But so far I am pleased.  The biggest cons I have with this crib tent would be that the zipper is loud.  I usually take out her musical seahorse, and cover her up before I go to bed.  I try to be as quiet as I can, but it sometimes makes her stir.  Thankfully it hasn't woken her up yet.  The other con is using it with a video baby monitor. The mesh makes it hard for the monitor camera to see in the crib.  I had to move the camera several times before finding somewhere that gave me a reasonable view.  For us, the pros of this product far outweigh the cons. Sleep is a precious commodity at our house. It was worth every penny we paid for this crib tent for her to get better sleep, thereby allowing me to get better sleep.",12/4/2011

After sleeping with a light or tv on we wanted to get some type of night light. I was weary of this since it doesn't play music and it looked kind of generic to me. However this is the best thing we've bought our son yet. The first time turning it on, his eyes lit up and he got really excited. We use it every night now and turn it back on during our middle of the night feedings. He immediately looks up in awe and starts to get sleepy again. I've put this on a shelf, on the floor, and even in his bassinet when he wasn't in it and it's always worked perfectly. For the amber glow to work you need a very dark room, but hey that's what the middle of the night is. The amber glow also seems to be the most calming and puts him to sleep quickly.

After reading some of the other reviews I was worried.  Yes, the movement alarm will sound every other second when you first turn it on.. there's a dial on the camera labelled sensitivity that needs to be adjusted properly (or disabled) before you use the system.  The only thing that surprised me, but in retrospect shouldn't have, was that in order to use Skype you have to have the video monitor attached to a PC.  I didn't read that anywhere before purchasing, but it makes sense.  It's pretty cool that the monitor acts as a wireless video camera for chatting.  It shows up as a normal webcam.  The temperature does read as warmer than it should, but this can be taken into consideration when setting temperature-based alarms.

We are still using it three years on with our second child. Folding is about as simple as it gets and it pretty much lives in the back of our Prius with decent room left over for bags and groceries. Nothing has broken on it. There are a LOT of more expensive strollers and combi systems, but I'm not really sure what they could do any better. This one hits the real sweet spot. Most other similar strollers with an infant seat system are either quite a bit heavier, or much more expensive - or both. There are lighter strollers - but do they work with an infant carrier type car seat?  What we really wanted was a combi system (stroller/car seat) that was light enough for my wife to lift and put in the trunk. Most of the combi strollers we looked at were more like 25-30 pounds. This is only 17 lbs. Believe me, it makes a difference when you lug these things around 4-5 times a day for a few years.   This works perfectly with the matching SnugRide infant seat. That comes with a detachable base, you can easily get extra bases for different cars. And everything is priced very reasonably.   I don't know if this is still the best on the market at this point, but it's been great for us.

This Contours Lite Stroller is awesome - lightweight and so easy to control.  I can push it one-handed and easily turn it, which is great when going in or out of a heavy swinging door (like at the doctor's office). Great storage underneath. Pretty easy to adjust up and recline down, although harder to push up with a baby in it.  I have 4 main complaints:  - The strap between the baby's legs is a simple narrow strap so it kind of digs into him. He is cushioned by a diaper, but he is definitely applying pressure to the strap because the back always forces the baby to be semi-reclined  - only a single cup holder for the parent - no place to put keys, phone, etc. I bought a separate caddy [[ASIN:B000SMWUPS Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy]] that velcros onto the handlebar and that works well, but that was an extra $15 or so.  - The canopy sort of snaps open because it resists opening and then all of a sudden opens. Same with closing, but slightly less dramatic snap. When my baby is sleeping, I hate to be opening or closing the canopy since it's so loud. But my baby generally sleeps though it so it's not much of a problem.  - The shoulder straps are difficult to adjust, or at least I haven't figured out how to do it. If you can't just grab something and intuitively figure out how to adjust it, it's not a good design.  The price is great ($54 or so) and it is light and easy to maneuver, so it generally suits my purposes. I may add padding to the crotch strap as my baby gets older.",12/4/2011

I love that it has a built-in nightlight, but that has also been acting strangely - it doesn't always turn off (again, I have to unplug the power cord from the back to shut it off).<br /><br />As far as music selection goes, it's good but not great. It doesn't have that many songs on each set so it loops over and over (which, I would personally find annoying so I don't put my son through it).

However, it was made with such poor quality material & so badly designed that it is really a huge waste of money.   The plastic on the outside is so brittle, that if it falls on a hard surface, such as concrete, it is prone to shattering, leaving sharp, jagged edges that you would never put near your baby's mouth. Also, it doesn't take long before the closure no longer closes all the way, defeating the purpose.  Furthermore, the clip is just as fragile. The handle that opens & closes the clasp snaps off much too easily, rendering the clip useless. I had to replace both so many times that after 6 months, I gave up entirely & went with another brand, MAM. Both the pacifier & the clip are made of much sturdier materials & the design of the clip is such that the moving parts are much less likely to break off. You're better off just keeping pacifier wipes handy for when it gets dirty. The cost of replacing the pacifier & clip so often far exceeds the cost of the wipes.

Only at over 5 months old now, it has become a bit of a distraction when trying to get her down: she loves to play with it (giraffe is what we have, which is totally cute) and the stuffed animal is something to tug on, thus pulling it out of her mouth.

Before we found that our daughter prefers the GumDrop, we tried the following pacifiers (because we received a ton at my baby showers):   1) Philips Avent Soothie Pacifier - look similar to GumDrop, but doesn't have the nook cutout around the nose  2) NUK latex pacifier and the Nuk silicone - have the angled tip upwards  3) various MAM pacifiers - shorter oval sized stem and silicone  4) Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier - angled tip upwards    Our daughter preferred silicone to latex and wasn't picky at first, but once she hit 6 months, she wouldn't take any of the others than her GumDrop!  We don't give out 5 stars easily unless we really love something, but these GumDrop pacifiers are the best.  One thing to note - I wasn't sure what the difference was between the newborn vs. full-term GumDrop pacifier - newborn was what we received in the hospital on the package but it said full-term on the ones we ordered here on Amazon.  From what we can tell, we believe the only difference is the thickness/consistency of the silicone.  The newborn ones appear to be a little thinner/softer type of silicone and the full-term ones are a little thicker/sturdier perhaps since they chew harder especially now that there are teeth!  There is no difference in the length of the stem or the overall shape of the pacifier.  We purchased the natural scent as we thought that was safest and we just make sure to wash them often so they don't get the plastic type of smell pacifiers sometimes carry.  But next time we may try to order the vanilla scent just to see what the difference may be.    Pros:   - Love the nose cut-out because they can breathe easily without interference and it is made to conform to their face comfortable - not like the Soothie that takes up their whole face!- Hole for stem is easy for her to put her finger through when she wants to chew on something with some substance  - Medical-grade silicon -> dishwasher safe  - One piece of silicone is easy to clean and doesn't collect in hard-to-reach crevices  - Soft and pliable -> no nipple confusion when breastfeeding  - Firm enough that your little one can chew away but lightweight  - Hole that you can loop a pacifier strap through it to attach to their clothes  - Available in four colors: pink, purple, orange and blue    Cons: NONE!*  *One we received from the hospital recently cracked (after 7.5 months of use) as she liked to chew on all sides of them now that she can grab them herself and she was bending them backwards (against the way they are made to fit smoothly against their face).  I tried giving her one of the others we had until I could order some GumDrops and she put them in her mouth, immediately pulled them out and laid them on the ground all in a matter of two seconds.  That's why I think the full-term are helpful because it's a sturdier silicone likely better equipped for older babies/toddlers.    Just recently we saw [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Pink/Purple]] are now sold at Target and they have the same shape and appear to be almost identical to these but these also are offered in one more color, green.  I did buy some just to see if they were different and I noticed the difference in the thickness of the silicone in these much clearer than the ones on Amazon.  The First Years 0-3 months version is softer/thinner/more pliable than the 3+ months version which is a thicker/sturdier silicone.  The best price is still on Amazon, but still a good back up if you're ever in a bind.",7/8/2011

Saw an ad for the gumdrop pacifier made by the same company with the same nipple shape but a nice nose cut out.

So if it does fall out, it can usually be recovered by your little one.  This was a lifesaver during a 7 hour car ride!

This is because the paci is attached to a little piece of fabric (rather than directly onto the caterpiller), so it's wobbly.

It was cute and I understood it's function from the beginning beyond just having a pasi.  However it wasn't until I opened the package yesterday that I was disappointed (I'm due soon); the directions say to wash the pasi - got it, no biggie.  The animal - wash gentle dry low, got it.  Then as I was inspecting the product I realized the animal is sewn together WITH the pasi.<br /><br />This didn't make sense to me.  So you're supposed to wash the animal in the washer, with the pasi attached to it, allowing any soap you might use in the washer to soak into the pasi.  Or you could not use any detergent but either way I'm sure the pasi can't be washed in a washer too frequently.<br /><br />You can't remove or reattach the pasi unless you take the stitch out and then restitch the (or a new) pasi into the mouth of the animal.  I was expecting some clip or tie or something else other than permanent attachment of the two objects; for cleaning purposes this is completely unpractical.<br /><br />I gave it two stars instead of just one because it is adorable. It is another baby-item that may or may-not work depending on how my child takes it.

Also, other pacifiers are shaped too similarly to her milk bottles and she gets mad that milk doesn't come out of them. I also wasn't thrilled that you had to wash the paci with the toy. So being a crafty mom, i knew i could fix this so she would like it. I got it in the mail yesterday and as i predicted she just spit it out. so i took my seam ripper and got the pacifier off easily without hurting the toy. then i took one of the holders for the nam which come apart and there is a hole at the end where the tie for the clip goes through - it was the perfect size for the hole i had made. a few stitches and viola! popped the pacifier in the holder (i also like that it can spin around in the holder) and we were good to go. she had been crying for about 15 mins, i put it in her mouth, showed her how she could grab on to it and she was sleeping within minutes. she has fallen asleep with it 4 times since then. so, like i said - i loved the idea of this product but had to make it work for me. just an idea for some of you other crafty moms (or dads) out there ;)",3/11/2011

We figure we should just stick with what we have instead of experimenting. We found a similar-looking one by Avent but they weren't the same. Thank goodness Amazon has these. They are exactly the same as the one we got from the hospital except the color but the engraving on the pacifier is all the same. The color for the blue ones is actually much lighter in person than in the picture -- more of a transparent grayish light blue; very pretty though.<br /><br />I personally like how it's one piece so I don't have to worry about loose pieces coming off -- choking hazard. The pacifier is really soft. I know they make harder ones for teethers but these are the softer ones for newborns and non-teething babies. It's very easy to clean and long-lasting. We're actually still using the green one we got from the hospital but having spares make it easier if I have to clean them then I don't have to worry about not having a pacifier available if it's being sterilized. I sterilizes them in boiling water and they stand up to the heat very well.<br /><br />These pacifiers does tend to get stuff like lint and hair stuck on them because of their sticky-ish surface.

When I purchased these, the glow-in-the-dark feature was not important to me, as I really didn't expect the glow to last for long (c'mon folks, it's glow-in-the-dark - the technology hasn't improved much since 1985...haha).  As other reviewers have noted, the glow really does not last too long after the lights go out.<br /><br />I'm sure most parents who use pacifiers for their babies would agree with me on this - we have pacifiers floating all over the house, but it seems whenever you want one, none can be found.  For this reason, I did like the nighttime pattern on the pacifiers; it helps my husband and I to remember that those are the 'bedtime binkies' and when we find them around the house, to put them back into her bed, so we *always* have a pacifier for bedtime.  Yes, the base of the pacifier is larger than Avent's 'regular' design, but I find that the larger base prevents the pacifiers from falling through the slats on my daughter's crib, which happens to the 'regular' design frequently.  Perfect if she wakes in the night; she can find her binkie and replace it herself - which she does.  I'm really pleased with these, as I have been with all Avent products I have purchased.",2/9/2011

You might be thinking that if one's child is old enough to demand the soothie by name and color she is probably too old to be using this thing?  I say I would think the same thing.  Don't do what I did- break your little one's addition in the 9-12 month timeframe, becuase if you leave it until 20 months (where we are now) it's probably become your child's 'lovey' by now and they are well addicted.

Yes, it's true that the baby can fit the whole thing in his mouth (my son did it once when he was about 5 months old) but there is absolutely no way that he would be able to swallow it. Plus the slits on the sides would not allow him to suffocate either (the air or saliva can still flow freely). The baby can get a little scared if it got stuck in his mouth but that's about it.

The size of the nipple is much better then that big berry nubby thing that looks like a ring pacifier - that is way too big for her mouth and the nubs all over the nipple part seem to be uncomfortable for her.    What I don't like:    She is 4 months old now, we got it a month ago.  She is teething and chewing on things, but could not hold/manipulate this until recently for any length of time.  Wanted a nipple that she would suck on and the nubs would be right under her gums if she bit down - this doesn't have that, nubs are only on the sides.

What I mean is if you are in the car and he's hungry and you need to buy 10-15 minutes to get home to nurse, letting him suck on the pacifier will keep him from a total meltdown. It also is invaluable if he has missed his sleep window and needs the soothing of sucking to settle him down. We tried the other kind that has the wider rubber piece, but I found it would make him gag. I bought these at the grocery store late one night when we were desperate and couldn't find our others and this one was hospital recommended. They are a good pacifier. A few drawbacks to me is the little handle can be awkward and the breathing holes aren't very big. Having said that he had a easier time using this one than any others and the nipple wasn't too big for him as a newborn. Now we only use it occasionally when we need to buy some time to get home and he's hungry or tired. Be careful not to keep these lying around where pets can get to them, because we have found our cats love to chew on these!",9/28/2010

Even on a pacifier holder, they would fall onto his clothes or blanket & pick up dust and hair instantly. So to say I was excited about this product would be an understatement. Here is what I wish I had known before I purchased it:    The keep-it-kleen pacifiers DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE! They have a mechanism that keeps the cover open, until it is jarred/knocked, at which point it snaps shut. This is great for pacifiers that fall on a hard floor from a substantial height, but when it just gently rolls or falls from my son's mouth when he is in his car seat or stroller, the impact is not enough to make it close, so it just stays open, lying on his shirt/blanket/whatever picking up hair.     Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, it does not have very good air flow, so the inside of the pacifier tends to fog up instantly and I'm not sure this is very hygienic.    In summary, I guess that a pacifier that closes some of the times it is dropped is better than one that never closes (ie a regular pacifier), but for the price, and the fact that it doesn't work in both large and small drops, I would not recommend it.",2/11/2010

He was so angry at the doctors, that this calmed him right down.  By the end of his visit he was asleep.  When I researched the soothie, I came across these and so far he loves them.  For whatever reason he favors the blue over the orange, but loves them both.  When he's super fussy, we give him these and he tends to calm down faster. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1/14/2010

Let me count the ways:  1.  One piece construction means they are easy to clean.  We had problems with dirt collecting in the seal or soapy water getting stuck in the nipple of other pacifiers.  With Gumdrop, dirt or germs have no where to collect and hide.    2.  Medical-grade silicon means we can boil the pacifiers to sterilize them or run them through the dishwasher.    3.  Soft nipple that my baby loves.    4.  Firm frame that my baby loves to teeth on constantly, but it's not too hard for her little teeth and gums.    5.  Durability!!!  I wish every product was as durable as these pacifiers!  We've been using them 24/7 for 10 months and they are still in perfect condition.  I check them regularly for wear since she chews so hard on them and we treat them pretty rough, but so far they're perfect!    6.  BPA safe.  Yes, they are.  The center frame is not BPA free, however, it is completely covered by the medical-grade silicone so the baby is never in contact with the center frame.  You shouldn't use it IF the silicone layer becomes compromised, obviously.  (Perhaps if you ran them over with a car, the silicone layer would be compromised.  Otherwise, it holds up amazingly well.)    7.  The cut-out for the nose seems like a little thing, but it's a big thing to my baby.  This is the only one-piece pacifier with the nose cut-out that I could find.    8.  Little hole for a binky strap to loop through, which is critical for us.

As I read the packaging I saw they have a polycarbonate base surrounded by silicone.   BPA is used to make polycarbonate.  The BPA is surrounded by silicone, but if the silicone barrier fails you are giving your baby BPA to suck on.  I did notice the packaging very carefully says pthalate and latex free, but no mention of BPA because it is not BPA free.  Too bad because I do like them better than the soothies, but for me it's just not worth even the potential risk of spending a good part of the day sucking on BPA.  edited to add:  I noticed that they are now listed as BPA free on the website and emailed them.  They sent me back a note that they made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the ones with polycarbonate!  I found that very very reassuring and would now happily use them.

He is 14 months and still loves to carry it around.  I was worried because the soothie pacifier can't be detached but these have lasted 14 months and I throw them in the washer/drier and they come out like new.  They claim to be for up to age 3-6 months but they are actually quite durable.  Soothie makes pacifiers for older kids but not in a Wubbanub.      We get these for gifts for anyone we know is having a baby.  Because they are attached and weighted down (like a beanie baby) they are great for young babies who can't hold a pacifier by themselves.
