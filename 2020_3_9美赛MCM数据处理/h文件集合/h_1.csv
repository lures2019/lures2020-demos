Makeovers and upgrades don't always yield the best results. For instance, this 1875 replica. Lacks the basic functions a blow dryer should have, such as temperature adjustment. There is only a setting for high and low fan speed. Also, in order to use the air only feature with no heat, the cooling button has to be pressed and held down to use this basic function. This causes a person's fingers to get tired, holding a button over using a sliding switch. Then there is the retracted cord that is missing. That was probably the most valuable feature for the original Conair 1875. Made the dryer much more portable. Even useful when not traveling. Now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter. The original is much better.

I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally's years ago.  Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  She told me I should try it.  When I used the rusk I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  I was in LOVE!!! It was a huge step up from the twinturbo.  I had to have the rusk, so I returned the twinturbo.  I could not be happier w the customer service.  Refund was super smooth.  So for the drier 3 stars customer service via Amazon and the seller 5 stars.<br /><br />Pros:  Dries fast, smooth results, nice button position.<br /><br />Cons: Heavy, the wind screen on the back has no cover, just flimsy screen.

I've looked at this one online a few times but couldn't justify the price.  Then it  went on sale and I jumped on it.  Just got it, first use.  It's not silver, like the one pictured, but I didn't buy it for color so I don't care (mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  Beautifully packaged, easy to understand directions/ switches (and they should be- I'm drying my hair, not launching a rocket into space).  A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I'm guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  The odor did go away and it was never overpowering and didn't make me think the dryer was going to explode in my hand or anything.  The dryer did NOT dry my thick, mid-back length hair in 5 minutes (as was claimed by another reviewer, I think) but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  Took about 22 minutes down from 40-50 (and would still have damp spots), and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because.....MY HAIR LOOKS AWESOME.  Seriously.  I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I'm not kidding.  I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste just sitting inside writing an Amazon review, but this baby deserves it so I sat right down to do it.  I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference (otherwise I'd have bought this ages ago), but truly, I look like I just walked out of the salon.

Finally a hairdryer that has powerful air, just the right heat settings, and doesn't break the bank. Three heat settings that feel like they should. Cold. Warm. Hot. Two speed settings, high and low. Very happy with the ease of selecting what I want, plus (again) the great air flow.<br /><br />A major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands. For such power, the Allure 2200W is a relatively quiet dryer. On a noise scale of 10, I would venture to say between &#34;4&#34; and &#34;6,&#34; depending on the settings. For comparison, I would rate most Conairs and probably most other blow dryers I've used at between 7-10. Not dis'ing Conair, just mostly been using that brand for the past decade.<br /><br />My only wish is that the Allure buttons were on the right side (as opposed to facing inside toward your head), as I find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press.

I get great curls and less frizz. On occasion I use the directional attachment to straighten my bangs or all of my hair and I love that too. Makes my hair silky smooth.<br /><br />The last time I bathed my dog I used the other nozzle that is supposed to be &#34;quick dry.&#34; That was really amazing. Dried my little dog in no time. I was happy and she seemed to be relieved. I imagine that if you don't need to worry about frizz, this quick dry nozzle would be great if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />I've had this for several weeks and I would recommend it. Hoping this one lasts quite a while!",8/12/2015

IT COULD SAVE YOU FROM BEING BUYING A DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT COULD BURN YOU!<br /><br />When I opened up the package, the packing for the blow-dryer was bent and looked open. Despite that, I thought maybe it just got damaged from shipping. When I opened up the package, it looked used. The blowdryer itself and the attachments (especially the diffuser) were all scratched; almost like they were used. Still, I thought, &#34;Maybe this was just a packaging issue and got damaged via UPS or during the shipping process.&#34; I wanted to test out the product before returning it. I severely regret even trying out this item before returning it.<br /><br />I plugged in the blow-dryer and attached the diffuser attachment. It didn't seem to blow air very well at all. My $25 Conair blow-dryer actually blows out more air than this did! I only had the blow-dryer plugged in for maybe a minute and realized it just didn't work. I actually got burnt because the diffuser got so hot! I now have a little welt on me from accidentally touching it. I can easily seeing this blow-dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody! I will never buy a 'Pro Beauty Tools' item again. The fact that this item was even labeled as a &#34;professional,&#34; blow-dryer is a joke. It blows no air and is cheaply made. The supposed $150 value is a joke, as well. Like I said, my $25 Conair blow-dryer is much, much better than this joke of a dryer<br /><br />Now I have no blow-dryer, a mini welt and irritated skin. Save your time, physical health and money and buy something else. Like I said, I can really see this endangering somebody -- whether by burning them severely (I wasn't even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt) or causing a fire of some sort. The diffuser attachment also stayed hot for quite awhile which I've never seen before with a blow-dryer before.",7/25/2015

I was looking for something inexpensive and high quality, which often doesn't go together.<br /><br />The good: For the most part, this dryer does exactly what it says it will. It dried my hair slightly faster than my previous dryer, and left it frizz free. I have very fine hair, so it almost always gets poofy. The tapered end made it easier to target the air to the rolling brush, which makes a big difference when compared to a snub nosed dryer (those aren't professional beauty terms, just the best words I can think of to describe the product). It's a decent size and easy to store. The motor is VERY quiet compared to other hair dryers I've used. My boyfriend gets up an hour later than I do for work, and he definitely appreciates the quiet motor.<br /><br />The bad: Just an aesthetic thing, it smells weird. To be fair, it's brand new so it's probably the smell from the packaging; but it also produces a faint odor when the motor runs that reminds me of like a toy blow dryer. I'll update the review if the smell goes away. For it's average size, it's fairly heavy. I'm not sure if it's because a larger motor, heavier materials, etc. I was using it for about 10 mins and my arm started to get sore! It's not insanely heavy, definitely manageable, but I would give it a higher ranking if it was a lighter and easier to hold. Also, the controls operate opposite any dryer I've ever had. So, instead of sliding the control up to get a faster speed or hotter temp, you slide down. That has definitely taken some getting used to. Finally, the attachments are just OK. They connect to the dryer well, but if you're like me, you are kind of a klutz when blow drying your hair. I usually knock the dryer with my brush or my hand at some point during the drying process and the attachments fall off at the slightest bump.<br /><br />Overall - it does what it says it will and does fine for what I paid for it. In hindsight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.ight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.",7/25/2015

I had been impressed with my hair stylist's hair dryer, but I knew such an expensive unit was out of my budget. However, I was willing to spend a little more than $20 on a drugstore hair dryer that, hopefully, would last a bit longer this time. I have very short, very, very fine hair. When it was longer, I used to require a diffuser since it is naturally wavy; however, with my current pixie cut, I knew I only really needed a unit that came with a concentrator nozzle. Because of the short-length and fineness of my hair, I also wanted a unit that had a good range of temperatures and speeds. A lot of what's available on the market now is too hot and too powerful for my hair. I did a bit of research for hair dryers that matched my criteria and finally settled on this. The extremely positive reviews left by other Amazon customers gave me confidence I had made a good decision.<br /><br />Happily enough, turns out I was correct! This unit feels solid. It is well-constructed, and doesn't have the &#34;hot spots&#34; like my old Con-Air did that caused its paint to flake off everywhere. It is a touch heavier than my old dryer, but I like the way it feels in my hand. The bit of added weight does not make the unit any more difficult to use. It is also powerful! The motor on this dryer is of much better quality than any I've used previously, causing an increase of air throughput that allows the unit to dry hair very quickly. Paradoxically, this unit performs much better than any 1875 W hair dryer I've ever used, and yet it is much, much quieter, and range of airflows gives it finesse. It comes with 3 different temperature settings and 3 different airflow settings, and I have found the medium temperature and medium airflow to be perfect for my needs. If you use the highest temperature setting, it will get hot! So if you need the high temp and high power, it is definitely there for you. It also comes with a concentrator nozzle, the output width of which in my opinion, is the perfect length. Some nozzles tend to be exorbitantly wide, which is probably fine if you have a lot of hair. But the output width of this nozzle is only around 2&#34;, perfect for a shortie like me.<br /><br />What more can I say? I am extremely happy with this purchase. It does arrive in a box that looks like it came straight out of the late 80s/early 90s, which I just found to be humorous. It is very no-muss, no-fuss, and I don't even think mine had packaged instructions with it. But it works just as well as my stylist's professional dryer and at a terrific price point. I would buy again in a heartbeat (but hopefully I won't have to, at least for a long, long time).",7/23/2015

The Remington AC2015 does its job nice and quickly.<br /><br />I have long (almost waist length), thick, and very straight hair. I wash them every 2-3 days using natural products (Lush shampoo and conditioner), and also oil them a couple times a week (Jojoba oil + either rosemary or lavender essential oil). I use a wooden brush - but only when they're dry. So yes, I really love and care for my hair! But when it comes to drying them, I can't imagine to spend a lot of time doing it. My drying routine is simple: 1) I remove most of the water with a towel (gently) and use my fingers to remove tangles; 2) then I blow-dry my hair upside down; 3) finally, I brush them. The whole procedure takes me approx. 15 minutes, using the maximal power (level 3) and heat (again 3) of the hair dryer.<br /><br />My husband has way shorted and fewer hair than I do, straight and thin. He uses my same shampoo and conditioner, but won't do anything more than that. He wouldn't need to use a hair dryer, but love the feeling. It takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry.<br /><br />My dog is a Scottish Terrier - so she's small but has longish and super thick fur. We wash her in the bathtub with natural Castille soap. To dry her fur, we first wrap her in a towel, and remove most of the water, then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat (level 2) and cold air to avoid burning her skin. When she starts being somewhat dryer, we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair (e.g. armpits). It takes us approx. 1 hour.<br /><br />To sum up, this hair dryer is durable and high quality - a great bang for the buck!",7/18/2015

Place your hair cradled in the dryers teeth and THEN turn it on. Hold for as long as you need, then turn the dryer off before moving to a new section. Any time this dryer is not full of hair and right up next to your scalp, it's making a frizz mess.<br />3. After drying 75% of the way, stop and clip up your roots to avoid flat head. I find that the hair next to my scalp is still a little damp and susceptible to flatness.<br /><br />It's a fine dryer, and I use it occasionally when I'm in a hurry, but for curly hair (I'm a 2c/3a with fine hair) I find it's always best to air dry.",7/16/2015

This is not a fluke but  bad design components. When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord. This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel.

Later that day I started wondering why it hadn't blown a breaker and decided that possible lint had accumulated and touched the burner wire. I did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if I had solved problem. No!  After about 10 seconds smoke came out, there was a burning smell, and the handle got hot. Obviously this is the last of this product for us. The warranty is out by 6 months and if it had just quit working that is one thing.

I went to Italy so I set the switch for 220v before I left so I wouldn't forget.  The first time I plugged it in (with an adapter), I double checked to ensure it was set to 220.  I switched it on low and it was working fine.  I then switched it on high, and within seconds it became red hot.  I looked at it and immediately pulled the plug as it was just about to shoot flames.  When I looked at the voltage, it had changed back to 110.  With the dryer unplugged, I set it back to 220 and toggled the hi/lo switch.  What I realized is that it worked fine on the low setting.  The moment the setting was changed to hi, it also changed the voltage back to 110.  Once I got this figured out, I used it on low for the entire trip with no issues.  Low was enough to dry my shoulder length hair.",7/5/2015

I have always taken care to dry my hair carefully and thoroughly with a round brush; however, after a stint in the Florida heat I am all frizz again.  I decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one.  I do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over $50 which just seems like too much to me.  The Remington AC9096 had both great reviews and a reasonable price and best of all -- IT WORKS.  I can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft, smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair that stays frizz free even when I am outdoors.

Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the $20 ones I have been using my whole life.  I couldn't be more wrong!  This dryer is truly head and shoulders above anything I've tried before.  Please read on to hear about the technology, results and how to properly use this should you be convinced to take the plunge!<br /><br />The Technology<br />Rather amazing technology here from the engineers at Panasonic.  Using a high electric potential they create negative ions which trap water molecules from the air and combine them with the hot air jet of a conventional dryer.  By doing this, they buffer the air jet with moisture which in turn prevents damage to hair.  Panasonic has been leaders in this area of technology which is why Japan enjoys the best selection of such hair dryers.<br /><br />The Results<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, hair is dried quicker and with softer, shinier results!  My hair is short, but for most women with longer hair, the results should be even better!  It is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat, so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair.<br /><br />Before you use:<br />You must be aware of the electrical requirements for using this fine hair dryer.  Since it was designed for the Japanese domestic market, it is made for their electrical system, not the U.S.  Although the plugs in Japan and the U.S. look the same, the electricity supply is very different.  I am an electrical engineer and I have lived in Japan, continue to use many Japanese products in the U.S. so I understand the differences well and how to work around them.  In Japan they use 100 volts, however in the U.S. we use 120 volts.  That means by plugging in a Japanese product directly into the U.S. system, you would overload the product by 20%.  For a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design!  Indeed some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.<br /><br />See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).  I have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer.  Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)<br /><br />I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.  I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  Furthermore, I would not hesitate to purchase a Japanese transformer used on eBay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal (they come up from time-to-time.)<br /><br />5 stars!  When used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair!d some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.

Yes, the<br />controls can easily get flipped around, but the temp and<br />air flow is ideal for those of us with super fine  and fragile<br />curly hair.  Whatever they are doing to these ion hairdryers<br />is nothing desirable for me.  They always frizz me out.<br />  I use the high heat high speed setting with the hot air<br />pik to straighten and volumize my hair, or use round brushes<br />and vary the heat along each section of hair.  No matter how<br />I style it, I come out with much shinier less frizzy hair.<br />Rewind about 2003-2004: Bought this model in a store,<br />loved it, and used it til it died in about 2007. Bought<br />another from a different store.  Everything was fine at first.<br />Then when I would use it the breaker would trip.  At first<br />it only happened once or twice, which is just one of those<br />things that can happen for no good reason.  I bought another<br />after the electrician ok'd everything.  I figured it was just a<br />bad dryer.  So I bought one more from a different store.<br />Worked fine until it sparked and a flame came out the end.<br />After a burned hand I decided I should try and find another<br />dryer.  Around 2012 I was talking to a friend who works in<br />the salon industry and she told me the company that made<br />my favorite dryer had changed the way they made them.<br />That made me think it was worth one last shot.  I have moved<br />from where I used all my other dryers.  First couple dries went<br />great.  However, I don't trust it not to use it in a non GFCI<br />outlet.  Last couple times I used it the GFCI activated and<br />turned it off.  Now I'm convinced it is a safety hazard, or<br />at the very least a challenge the electrical system doesn't<br />need.  I'm heartbroken over that.  If the manufacturer could<br />address that problem, I would be SO happy.<br />The seller on Amazon was reasonably priced and got my<br />item to me quickly and ingood condition.",6/9/2015

And ... that unit still runs but the thermocouple switch that shuts the unit off when it overheats has &#34;worn&#34; over the years and has begun to engage a little too quickly. (Note that not keeping the lint filter clean will cause this issue as well, due to restricted airflow over the thermocouple).<br /><br />Indeed, a pretty darn good unit for the money. After a couple of years of use (literally, used hundreds of times in that period) the &#34;ears&#34; or &#34;fingers&#34; that hold the dryer became worn, or loose, so the hairdryer would fall out. This was solved by placing a strip of Velcro on the inside of each &#34;ear&#34;.  Would have given product 5 stars if this had not occurred. Found that this easy &#34;repair&#34; needs to be repeated every couple of years.<br /><br />From my experience, definitely would not hesitate to recommend. Conjecture is that those who experienced short life with this appliance may not have cleaned the lint filter as often as required.

After purchasing a Chi & Sedu I was hesitant to purchase the Onei. This by far has surpassed my expectations & my experience with the Chi & Sedu. I need a hairdryer to meet my needs: dry without loss of volume & decrease amount/use of root/shine styling products. Very surprised at how gentle the air flow comes out & how fast my hair dries.  I assume it's based on the barrel shape of the Onei dryer vs a more cylindrical barrel like some dryers. The packaging of the dryer far exceeded my expectations. The quality of the Onei feels/looks better than the sedu I purchased months ago. So far very surprised & looking to see if this will outlast my last dryer a wigo(5yrs).  I have had this dryer for only a month & have not heard of this brand before. That's why I only gave it a 4. So far loving it better than the Sedu & Chi.,6/5/2015

After my favorite dryer broke, I looked for one like it that is lightweight, has power but not too much power, and most importantly, has the high/low/off switch on the BACK of the dryer handle, not in the front.  All of the dryers I have looked at in the past have the switch(es) on the front of the handle.  This is a problem for me, because when I style my hair with a dryer and a round brush, I have to constantly turn the dryer on and off.  With the buttons on the back of the handle like this one, I can turn it on and off with one hand.  When the buttons are on the front of the handle, I have to set my brush down to turn it on and off with two hands.  What a hassle!  This lightweight dryer with the on/off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly.  I will probably buy another one as a back-up for when this one wears out.  I highly recommend this dryer, and you can't beat the price!",6/5/2015

I was impressed immediately with this dryer.  It is beautiful.  It is slightly heavier than my last one,  but it cut drying time considerably so I don't think this will be an issue.  It has three speeds.  It has three temperature settings. The highest is hotter than any blow dryer i have ever used.  I just dried my hair with it and my naturally wavy hair is so straight that I don't need to break out my flat iron. Yes, I am amazed by this thing! The medium heat setting is equivalent to my last dryers hottest setting.  I have twin daughters that are young and I think the only setting cool enough to dry their hair with is the lowest heat Setting. This dryer is so powerful,  yet a ton quieter than my previous dryer. My husband even commented on how quiet it is. My husband also liked the fact that it is heavier.  Being a mechanic he said it probably has a stronger,  more durable motor. I was reading the booklet that was included, and this dryer has a four year warranty.  That's pretty astounding considering the price point.

It is a *little* heavier than some models, but I'm only using it for a max of 15 minutes a day so that doesn't bother me. And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con. As for how quiet it is, I would say it's as quiet as the other &#34;quiet&#34; dryers I've owned made by other companies. It's not a whisper, but it's not a scream. My hair looks better than it has in a long time... It's certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer. The dryer is also a very sexy looking piece, so if you're going buy based on looks, go for this machine! The only negative I have is the cold shot button. I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future. I try to avoid using the shot button in favor of the cold setting switch to prolong the inevitable, though.  I truly do love this dryer.

It fits standard hair dryer attachments too -  like a diffuser. It also comes with the attachment that focuses the air blast - I think it's called the nozzle, but it's key to minimizing damage on your hair.<br /><br />My last hair dryer (from a different brand) was closer to $65 and although it worked great, it started to breakdown within a couple of months. It finally cracked it half in my checked bag during a recent flight. The price was right for this dryer - and I love the customer-centric focus of the company, xtava.<br /><br />I also love the follow up communication I received after buying this - tips for how to use it well, contact info if I have any problems.

(Med-length wavy hair),"I realized a bit too late in my adult life that a good blow-dryer makes all the difference in the look and feel of your hair. I simply could not figure out why my hair was always kind of &#34;sticky&#34; and not quite fully dry when I got out of the shower and tried to dry my hair with my 5+ year old Conair that I bought at CVS very inexpensively.<br />I did some research online and scoffed at the $150+ dryers that were being promoted. This one was on the list, and honestly, given the relatively lower price point versus the other professional dryers, I was willing to try it out.<br />WOW. I have used it now about 3 times, and it is hard to believe what a significant difference I see in my hair. I styled it myself for a formal Gala event, and was able to achieve the shiny look, feel, and volume in my hair that any professional stylist could achieve. It was unreal. Even on a work day I feel so much better about myself having simply styled my hair with this blow dryer. It targets the hot hair wonderfully and leaves my hair so dry, shiny and healthy.<br />I went back and ordered one to send to my mom! She is also a victim of ignorance-to-bad-dryer-itis, so I went ahead and sent her the cure.<br />Happy Drying!",4/15/2015

It is very loud as I think one reviewer stated.  That I could deal with but that was just one small detail.  The attachment for the hair curling I could not work, although that may just be me.  The settings for the hot and cold on this are right at the finger tips where you hold the dryer.  Therefore, if you are not careful you will be drying on warm instead of high.  You start wondering why its not getting dry.  I have had to change it back as many as 20 times in one hair drying session.  And now the last and & most frustrating feature of the dryer.  The concentrated hair drying attachment that was stated in the description of the product as coming off for easy cleaning, unlike most other models.  Well yes, it does come off for easy cleaning alright, it just blows it across the room as you are drying your hair.  You just don't want anyone else in the room with you for you never know where the line of fire may be.  It blows off with quite a force so I am sure it would hurt someone, particularly a small child.  I owned a Vidal Sassoon Dryer before but never one like this.  I cannot recommend this product and will not purchase another one of this brand.  It was inexpensive so I guess its true, you get what you pay for.  Not worth paying return shipping so I use it as it is until my new one arrives.",4/10/2015

This hair dryer is really not my favorite. I usually hold it by the base when I'm drying a client's hair but it gets so hot that I have to hold it by the handle, but when I do that I'm touching all the buttons and turning stuff on and off on accident. Also, the part that holds the filter on the back of the dryer keeps falling off that I had to tape it and now it looks terrible but it's the only thing that holds the piece on. Not to mention the metal grate on the back that holds the filter in keeps caving in constantly. I feel like these are not meant for travel, which is funny because it's travel size. Maybe I got a bad batch or something.<br /><br />Yes it's a powerful driver, but this seems more like it's aimed at a consumer than a professional which is sad because I had many professionals reccomend it to me.

What attracted me to this Andis was the &#34;salon grade&#34; and the ionic/ceramic attributes. Overall this is a good hair dryer, but it doesn't blow as hard as the Conair it replaced. This was HUGE for me, as I like a good air flow. It takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it, so we went back to our old brand. It does, however, leave your hair &#34;silkier&#34; which was a surprise to me. I didn't think an ionic dryer could do that, but it does. The two settings it has for wattage didn't seem to make much of a difference, but it's a nice touch. I'm sure there's a reason for the option, but I can't think of anything it's useful for. I put it on the high setting and let it go. The retractable cord is nice, but it doesn't reel the cord all the way in, leaving about 16in left dangling. After a few weeks of use, it reels in even less, now leaving about 20 or so inches hanging.<br /><br />Pro: Silky hair, somewhat retractable cord, two wattage settings (that I'll prob never use).<br />Con: Takes longer to dry long, thick hair as the air current isn't as strong as I'd like.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it, but if you don't mind a slightly weaker air flow, the ionic silkiness is worth it.",4/8/2015

Static was a big issue, so when shopping for a blower with high wattage, high heat (yes, I want HOT) and high velocity, I found this one hoping it would meet the requirements. I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale. I just did not meet the expectations, not enough blow, heat and I still had frizzy static hair. It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don't want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style. I did move on and purchased Onei MK-II for about $70 taking a really big chance. It blew me away literally and exceeded all expectations.

Well it did for awhile.,"Has a good volume of air on high for a compact unit, but the trade-off is it is a bit noisy too.  Not mention in the listing, but the blue button is a cool air button and works as would be expected.  Unlike the Revlon Rvdr5033 I had the cool button on this unit just turns the heat off and back on when released and does not change the fan.  It gets very hot on high and so did the Revlon.  Too hot it seems to me but it appears no one makes a 1500 watt model anymore.  I could find nothing but 1875 watt models even in compact.  Not pictured or mentioned but this one like all of them has the huge block on the cord end with a GFI and AC plug as part of that block.  Even though they tell you not to put two GFI's on the same circuit and there hasn't been a house built in almost 40 years without a GFI covering any outlet in every bathroom the requirement for this still persists.  I like that you can easily take the cover of the fan in the rear for cleaning.  Not many of the compact models seem to have that feature.  Overall a good unit.  Time will tell how durable and long lasting it is.  I can only hope it is as good in that area as the one it replaced.  Update 7/21/15: Well it is NOT very long lasting.

I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have fine shoulder length hair and it did not take an hour to dry, as another reviewer stated.  (Of course, I didn't attempt to dry my hair when it is dripping wet either.  I wrap my hair in a towel and do other things for a while before attempting to blow dry.)  Anyway, I was worried at first because the packaging and most of the instructions are in Japanese.  But I used it on the lower voltage and it was fine.  I used the regular brush to dry my hair, as I'm not sure how to use the round brush yet.  I dried most of my hair and then used this upside down to give my hair some lift and bounce, which it did.  Also, my hair does not look frizzy, like it does at times when using a regular blow dryer (I believe because sometimes a regular blow dryer both damages and tends to tangle your hair).  My hair actually looks shiny as well as smooth (as if I flat ironed it).  I would give this a try if you are someone who likes the look of their hair when it is blow dried and/or flat ironed but with what seems much less damage.

But the best feature about it, in my opinion, is that it is MUCH QUIETER than the less expensive model.  I get ready for work in the early mornings and this model produces a moderate hum, compared to the blasting roar the cheaper model makes.

With 1875 Watts, it dries even thick hair quickly when used on the high setting.  The handle folds to make it more compact for storage.<br /><br />This is a basic hair dryer wiith only two speeds, high and low, and one temperature unless you hold down the &#34;cool&#34; button at the top of the handle.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles of more expensive models -- no ceramic coils or diffuser or ionic upgrades.  The handle has a switch to convert from 125 V to 250 V, and you MUST know the voltage of the country you're visiting and manually change the setting or else risk starting a fire.  Remember to change it back when you get home.  A few countries, however, use lower voltages than 125: many Caribbean countries, Japan, Taiwan, and a few South American countries.  Check your destination before you go.  The hair dryer would be completely universal if the power pack handled a range between 100-250 V.  It would also be more useful if it converted automatically the way computer chargers do; however, I've never seen an automatic conversion on a hair dryer.<br /><br />On American current, this is a powerful little hair dryer.  Although most hotels supply hair dryers these days, it works well for those times when either you're not sure you'll find one and when you want to depend on something you know.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",3/27/2015

I've been pleasantly surprised with this dryer so far! I have very thick hair that usually takes forever to dry, even with a dryer, but this one is nice and light and doesn't make my arm feel like it's going to snap off after holding it for a few minutes. Probably the smartest part of the design is the honeycomb pattern over the back--it's pretty much impossible for my hair to get through it and get stuck in the blades. That makes drying much easier, since I can move the dryer through my hair without worrying about sudden-onset baldness and pain.<br /><br />It's not too loud, and it's definitely quieter than my old dryer. My only minor complaint is that the nozzle (is that what it's called? the duckbill-looking thing that concentrates air) will occasionally fly off in the middle of drying. I'm not sure if that's force from the air, or from moving the dryer around, but it's not quite as secure as it could be.

I almost cried the first time I used it.  Yes, if you hold the handle too low you can accidentally press the buttons, however, to modify that I simply hold it higher up and have no problems.  When this one dies, I'm most definitely buying another.....especially at such a great discounted price!",3/12/2015

Yikes!  While it did dry my very straight, fine hair quickly, the air flow was so strong that when I put my hair in velcro curlers, the Revlon hair dryer blew the curlers out of my hair!  So I went looking on my beloved Amazon to find a better hair dryer with lots of positive reviews, and ended up ordering this for about the same price I paid for the Revlon one.  This one is great--so much more substantial and quality feeling and noticeably quieter and less shrill sounding than the Revlon.<br /><br />My single complaint is that the toggle switches on the handle that control the air flow and heat settings are a little too easy to accidentally change when drying your hair.  But I still like this hair dryer a lot.",3/7/2015

Seems sturdier than other brands.  Dries hair quickly.  Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  Heat and air velocity both normal.<br />I went through 3 or 4 of a competing model that would last only 1-2 years and then burn out.  I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.<br />Bought a different competing model but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair so it was returned.<br />Finally bought this one.  It is not as aesthetically pleasing as competing models, but not quite as ugly as the photo makes it seem.  The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  The wall mount does not install flush to the wall, as others have mentioned, but it is close enough.  I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  I suspect build up of lint on the blades is what eventually caused the other dryers to burn out, and with the other dryers it is not possible to access the blades (at least not easily).  Thus, I expect this dryer to last longer.  There is also a &#34;hidden&#34; setting where you can turn the power up, and I did that when it first arrived.",2/26/2015

It's really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I'm sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer, the box itself or the paper insert that comes with it.  The hair dryer has somewhat cheap and plastic feeling.. the seams are somewhat poorly made- they scratch your hand when you touch them, and the cold shot button is not a real button per se, it's a piece of plastic hanging there, which I think can get stuck in or broken after some use.. Anyway, it's an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made.. I guess it makes it easier to write raving reviews about a product if you don't pay for it, but for the price you can get a little less powerful but higher quality product",2/24/2015

I previously had a Revlon with retractable cord that still worked, but it was REALLY hot. I have oily hair, so I have to wash it pretty much daily. The heat was killing my long hair. I took a chance on this and I am really glad I did. Initially, I was disappointed, but I am glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />1) Power! It has almost too much power for someone with long hair, my hair was FLYING all over the place (it also tangles easily). I added one of the 3 concentration nozzles and that really helped.<br /><br />2) Heat! Yes, its not super hot -- but heat isn't good either! It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying. With as much power going through it, I don't think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair.<br /><br />3) Buttons! Yes, the buttons are on the side. I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers. It takes some time to get used to a new one. I think people notice the difference a lot at first, but it really will go away and you'll get used to it. It hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this blow dryer. I can't say that my hair dries any faster than my previous dryer, but it will be much healthier in the long run and that's something I appreciate more than speed. It definitely does not take a long time by any means though. I am happy I got it!",2/11/2015

Even on cool or medium speed this thing is magnificent! Some of the reviews comment on this dryer being heavy, I'll share a secret...cheap dryers are superlight weight, but in all sincerity, this dryer is not heavy at all, so not sure why some reviews say this. The button placement was an issue when I read the reviews but decided to try it for myself, and what I personally found was, where I place my hand is at the bottom anyways, so it was a non issue for me. It's totally worth trying because everyone is going to hold their dryer in a different spot anyways, and if I didn't purchase this based on what others said about weight and button placement, I would have missed out on the BEST DRYER EVER, and believe me, I have tried them all.

I was super disappointed given my glowing review below. I have not even contacted Amazon or the manufacturer since it's past the 30 days. The wire below the handle started to heat up a little bit, I smelled smoke. At first thought it was my hair. But, the thing died shortly after. I have another blow dryer. Not sure if I received a lemon or if this is Andis quality. My past blowdryers from other reputable firms would last 7-10 years. 4 months was a HUGE let down  PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW:  Definite space saver. Quiet. Does the job. I feel the low setting is definitely very low, much lower than my travel blow dryer you can find at any drugstore. However, I like the higher setting. It's nice to wash, blowdry and head out. Makes my mornings much easier to have things in place and organized. This blow dryer comes with two long screws. You have to remove the baby screws on the plate on the back. I then marked the walls where the two holes are. The plastic anchors I did not use, because the frame/holder is super light weight. So is the dryer. It's nice. In addition, the green light makes a nice nightlight in the bathroom. Personally, I wish I could change the color to clear or blue. The photo they provide shows the cord hook is on the right side. There are two other sm/med size screws to hang the cord to either the left or right side. I prefer the right side; however it all depends on where you place it in your bathroom. It's a great product. They thought of almost everything on this dryer. The only two things I would change is to have even a more minimized holder (semi-translucent), optional colored dryers, retractable cord, small dryer, more powerful, cool air option dryer (i.e. fan with a hold button ;-), no cord but a chargeable blow dryer. I think that's about it.",2/1/2015

This button is rectangular and flat, again making it look and feel like it should be pushed up and not in.  Trying to push this button IN is often somewhat difficult (too thin; too highly set) and takes several tries.

But with this hair-drier, I found the answer!!! It has GREAT air-power, 2 heat settings, and dual voltage so you can take it on overseas trips as well. Barely adds any weight to your luggage (so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing.

(45min cut to 10min!),"Thought I was the only weirdo that struggled to dry her hair w/in 45mins.<br /><br />Recently found out my best friend is the same & she (like me) was convinced there was no way around it.  Writing this review b/c there's probably more of us out there.  And you 100% aren't stuck.<br /><br />I've got long, thin hair - but a lot of it.  It traps moisture & it's naturally wavy, so it always took me 30-45mins to tame it dry.  Most of the time, a solid 45mins.  Result was hit or miss.  Since I have to wash my hair every other day, breaking point comes when you don't want to wash your hair b/c you don't want to deal with the drying time & tired arms (...and I'm strong).<br /><br />Bought this on a whim during a Gilt Group sale, when my generic (probably Conair) dryer was on the out.<br /><br />Now I dry my hair in 10-15mins.  Usually, a bankable 10mins.  On a bad hair day, 15mins.<br /><br />No, seriously.<br /><br />On top of that pile of awesome, it's very light & evenly weighted.  Buttons are intuitive & don't get accidently knocked on/off while you use it.  Results are always the same.  Doesn't damage my hair w. heat (probably b/c it takes so little time).  And it's small enough that it's an easy travel companion.<br /><br />Don't get scared off by this dryer's price - it's a life saver.  And game changer.  Delay getting this if you want to waste your time.<br /><br />For the Holy Trifecta: this hairdryer, a boar bristle roller brush, & Shu Uemura White Tea Polishing Milk.<br /><br />This dryer & a boar bristle brush easily tames my hair w. little effort & leaves it looking silky smooth.  Every time.  (Note: choose a brush that has both natural boar bristles & taller plastic bristles w. the knob-like, non-scratchy tip - needs a decent amount of boar bristles, but few enough to let air through easily. It doesn't have to be expensive, just needs to fit those parameters.)  For doubled ease, get Shu's White Tea Polishing Milk.  A little goes a long way.  You'll be a happyaddict.  Rub some in your hands & pat it from middle of your hair to the ends, but particularly the ends to give them a little tangle protection.  It helps smooth my hair even faster & it lets my hair better tackle humidity - friends have commented that I look normal when they feel they don't.  PS - The brush & Shu isn't a hack - the dryer is.  The 3 together is trifecta.<br /><br />I was ecstatic to find this - I'd always struggled just to tame my stubborn hair.  Now I actually feel in control of it.  Just bought a replacement for my 3/4yr old original & also bought one for my mom as an xmas present. My friend's now a convert & begging for the name of my dryer.<br /><br />You won't regret.",1/26/2015

I've had mine for 3 months and my hair looks so silky and shiny!  My hair is very thick and frizzy/curly (slightly past my shoulders).  I used to have my hair professionally done (roller-set and blown out) every week when I lived close to my favorite hair salon.  When my husband and I moved, I couldn't find a salon that was close enough for weekly appointments, and it was just getting expensive.  I've had other standing hair bonnet dryers, but this is the kind I see most at professional hair salons, and for a reason.  It's fairly quiet (except for the ticking sound from the timer).  It goes up to 75 degrees Celsius, which is about 167 degrees Fahrenheit (very hot), but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps.  I usually keep mine at 65 degrees Celsius (about 150 F).  There is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour, which is what I need.  I don't have to worry about keeping track of time as the dryer turns off automatically with the time you set.  I just roller-set my hair, set the timer, and read or nap until the dryer stops.  I love it!  Caveat: While assembly is easy, it was not so smooth to do.  My husband had to re-order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time.

It has all the features:  More heat, at 1875 watts  ---  Salon quality motor - up to 40% more air flow and three times the service life  ---  Ceramic pearl technology (Ceramics for even heating, and infused with crushed pearls which transfer to hair)  ---  Ionic generator to bathe hair with positive ions  ---  Concentrator and diffuser blower attachments  ---  Three heat settings, two fan speeds, and a cool shot feature.<br /><br />I don't use hair dryers.  My wife does, and when she broke her old Remington T/Studio, she would have nothing but another T/Studio as a replacement.  By the way, this dryer has a 4 year warranty, so keep your receipt.  (In our case, the dryer was about 2 years old but we no longer had the receipt, and the breakage was due to her dropping it and the fan speed switch physically broke . . . so I appropriated the old dryer, wired the fan speed to permanent high and the old hair dryer now resides in my workbench to serve as my hot air gun when I need one).<br /><br />Not cheap, but a very high end dryer and worth the price for us.  By the way, the Amazon price was by far the best we could find at the time we bought this replacement.",1/12/2015

It did not get super hot (which was good for the window kit), though I have no idea if that's good or bad from a hair drying perspective. I could have bought a cheaper hair dryer, but I chose this one because it is tourmaline ceramic, ionic, has several attachments, and multiple settings including a cool breeze setting -- all with the idea that after I was done using it on the window kit, I could provide it to female guests. This turned out to be a good idea, since my housemate's younger sister is currently visiting, and she was happy that I had a hair dryer for her to use. I asked for her opinion, and she says, &#34;It's great.&#34; Pressed for more details, she says, &#34;I like that it has a lot of different settings.&#34; As it turns out, this is in fact the first hair dryer she has ever used.

This thing is great!<br /><br />No, it's not as powerful or capable as a &#34;full-sized&#34; dryer.  But, what do you expect from something that literally fits in the palm of your hand?  I, myself, expect a lot less than this dryer delivers.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of travel hair dryers, this one locates the fan at the back of the barrel and has some barrel length to it.  This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  It's not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it's better than most travel dryers.<br /><br />One reviewer reported that the controls are not labeled.  This is not true on the dryer I received.  The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.<br /><br />Several reviewers have complained of it making a very high-pitched motor noise, getting very hot, smelling bad, and then dying.  The unit is shipped set for 125V (USA) power.  While it is true that many modern electronic devices have &#34;auto-ranging&#34; or &#34;universal&#34; AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn't one of them.  If you plug this dryer into 250V (European) power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250V setting, the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described.  And that will be your fault, misuse, and not cause for a poor review.<br /><br />Mine has worked fine.  It drys my hair almost as fast as my &#34;professional&#34; dryer at home.  Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel.",1/6/2015

Actually worth the money!,"I've always been skeptical about new, amazing, breakthrough technology in beauty products.  I certainly believe there are different levels of quality and also that one product may perform better or worse on different people.  So I was hoping this dryer would make a difference, while being prepared for less than spectactular results.  So drum roll please...I personally thought my hair looked silkier, shinier and it did dry noticeably faster, but the shocker was that other people really noticed the difference!<br />My adult daughters to whom I am often apparently invisible, both asked me individually and on seperate occassions if I had just had my hair done, and what had I done differently etc.  Ironically, the evening that I had in fact come straight from the salon (and prior to using this product) warranted no notice.  I've had others compliment my hair as well.  I'm giving more weight to those who see me all the time and tend not to use flattery to judge that there was a very noticable difference.<br />  The other thing worth mentioning is that in my youth my hair was one of my best assests in terms of appearance.  For the past 10 years or so, its become a definite liability.  I joke that it's a fire hazard and I'm not allowed near open flame as it is so dry and so covered in product that its quite flammable.  I put a fair bit of effort into getting it to be healthier and less frizzy and I've actually had people ask me if I've ever tried a really good conditioner or anti-frizz product.  After what I hope is a chilling gaze I let them know I do believe I have tried nearly all conditioners/styling products. So it is a rare thing indeed for me to rave about a hair product or in this case hair dryer and I must give it a rave review!<br />  If you possess beautiful, soft, smooth heathly hair this may not be worth the money,  but if like me you color frequently and have those weird coarse alien hairs springing up randomly then I would say go for it!",1/6/2015

CONS:  It is the heaviest dryer I have ever owned, the buttons are so awkwardly placed that it is difficult to get a good grip w/out changing a setting, & it takes a long time to dry my hair (much longer than my last few dryers).<br /><br />Why did so many people rave about this?

First, this is NOT a particularly quiet hair dryer. Having been used to really quiet dryers in Europe, where the EU sets noise standards on such appliances, I have constantly been frustrated by the obnoxious noise levels of hair dryers here in the U.S. So, as American blow dryers go, this one is pretty good, especially on the SET setting, but it's certainly NOT exceptionally quiet. Nor is it lighter in weight than the dryer I currently have. So buy it for the functionality, but not for the sound level or the weight. However, one big advantage is that this dryer has a normal size plug, rather than the ginormous ones with the pop-out breaker that are common on other products sold in the U.S. Our bathroom outlets already have the pop-out breakers so we don't need them on appliances used in the bathroom, so not having to accommodate the giant plug is a big plus.",12/29/2014

I searched and searched for months unsure of who to believe. I have fine hair, not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand. This one works great for my fine hair, and a plus is that I have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers. There are two settings for ionic, and I don't know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times. The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch. Someone wrote a review that said they could actually hear the doorbell ring while using this hairdryer, and that convinced me to purchase this model. It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums. My husband can actually sleep when I blow dry, where he could not before.

I have personally gone through about 15 different hair dryers to find the perfect one.  I discovered the Remington Jet Dry Turbo about 10 or 15 years ago (it used to come in bluish/purple). During this time, I've often looked for other models just to see if I could find something better, and there just isn't anything.  Many times, you'll find me using two hair dryers at the same time (which often causes the bathroom circuit to overload). I used stylist models that cost around $150 (Bespoke, Rusk Speed Freak, etc.) to Consumer Reports Best Hair Dryer - which I think the people who are reviewing them don't have lots of hair... because nothing holds a candle to this model.<br /><br />They also have a compact one that I keep in my gym bag.  It's not as good, but will do in a pinch.",12/27/2014

I thought it was strange that it didn't get hot even on the highest heat setting...... it was still cool enough after several seconds that I could aim it directly at my face comfortably.  On the second try, it got hot for about 5 seconds.... and then went cool again.  Third try - no heat.  I am glad I kept the box so I can send it back for my replacement.    So I am exchanging this for the same design in hopes that the replacement will have a working heating element.  I still rated it as a moderate success because the high and low settings for air, and the three temperature settings are a wonderful design.  It blows really hard, which is what I like.  I also am hoping the diffuser will allow me to maximize the wave in my hair for those days when I don't want to straighten it (or when it's humid outside).  It's ilghtweight and has a nice feel to the grip.  I hope the replacement will up the rating to a full 5 stars!    UPDATE: I received my replacement (what a simple process, too... kudos for easy returns!), and this hairdryer is perfect for me.  Now that the heating element is working, I am able to see that the heat settings are just what I want, cool is cool, medium is my favorite for regular use, and hot is good and hot but not scorching (I might use this on the low blower setting to set a curl when my hair is in velcro rollers).  Very happy!  Love the feel and heft of it, too.",12/26/2014

Let me say that I went from a $150 Chi dryer to this.  All in all, it seems to dry my hair in about the same time (I have a lot of hair).  In my opinion, the main difference between inexpensive and expensive dryers is how long they last.  I've had the expensive one for about 3 years or more, no issues.  The good thing about this Revlon (in addition to the price) is that it is much lighter weight.  So, I'll keep using it until it breaks.  One other thing to note, the cool burst button is really easy to accidentally trigger when you're drying your hair. Not a big deal other than it annoys me when I'm trying to dry my hair and the cold air starts flowing and I have to adjust.",12/22/2014

It dries my hair in about half the time and I use both of the diffusers that came with if often.<br /><br />My reason for giving four starts over five is that the placement of the buttons for speed and heat are RIGHT where I want to put my hand while using it. They are pretty big, so if I keep my hands there I often hit them. Readusting my hand solves this problem but since it makes it a slightly less comfortable experience, I think four stars is appropriate.<br /><br />I have not (yet) had the issue of the outside wearing off, mine still looks new.",12/15/2014

This one came up with the most reviews in this price range. I know I shouldn't but I wash and dry my hair every day. I needed something reliable but under $30.<br /><br />The first thing that bothered me was that I received an obvious return which doesn't bode well. I've tried this for a couple days so the jury's still out but right away here's what I like and don't like about it:<br /><br />PROS<br />-very quiet<br />-lightweight<br />-useful attachments<br />-multiple speed options<br />-cool shot<br />-ability to clean filter<br /><br />CONS<br />-nozzle is longer<br />-matte finish makes it slippery to hold<br />-cool shot button is much shorter than older Conair<br />-easy to accidentally press/hold cool shot when you don't want it<br />-speed/heat button sliders very cheaply made<br />-filter is hinged and doesn't open all the way<br /><br />For price and value, okay buy. If you have short arms like I do, the longer barrel makes for an awkward morning ritual. Also, since it's slippery to hold, you have to learn how to hold it differently which can be problem, if like me, you have arthritis issues. With the old Conair, I could lazily hold it however I want. I could rest my thumb below the cool shot button since it protruded at least 1/2&#34; and you really had to push it down to use it. The cool shot on this one is flimsy and depresses quite easily. I'm also worried about the settings buttons. It does not seem very secure and/or there is only a small attachment in the middle. In other words, as you slide them, the top and bottom of the buttons are not attached in any way to the unit. They actually stick out a little bit (are not completely flushed against the handle). Whether this will be a problem should they come off remains to be seen.<br /><br />Overall a mixed bag but it was priced fairly cheap. Will update rating if it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I'm already drying it out by repeated washings).f it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I'm already drying it out by repeated washings).",12/2/2014

I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it, and needed a hair dryer with a diffuser. After looking through reviews I decided to purchase this one over some cheaper models or buying the same Vidal Sassoon model I've owned for many years.<br />My first impression was that I was shocked by how heavy it was, because it's ceramic. It can be sort of awkward to use before you get used to it. Secondly, the difference between the &#34;warm&#34; to the &#34;hot&#34; setting is pretty big. The &#34;warm&#34; on mine has barely more heat than the &#34;cool&#34; setting and the &#34;hot&#34; setting is too hot to use for more than a minute or two. The &#34;hot&#34; also makes my hair super frizzy, but that's fixed by blasting it on the &#34;cool&#34; setting after the heat. But I do worry that it damages my hair. I would use the &#34;warm&#34; setting if it didn't take so long.<br />This hair dryer is kept at my boyfriend's and I only use it to dry the roots of my hair with the diffuser to give them lift, so it doesn't see much use.

I never really gave much thought to my hair dryer and the potential damage it could do to my hair.  My last dryer (it was either a Clairol or Revlon-I threw it out after it starting throwing sparks) left my hair extremely dry after approximately two years' use.  I kept switching shampoos and conditioners, thinking that my hair was just changing and I needed to find a new product.  Turns out all I had to do was buy a new hair dryer!  Before purchasing this dryer, I read a few online articles that suggested a lower wattage dryer for fine hair.  That is basically how I ended up with this dryer-it was the lowest wattage dryer (besides a travel dryer) for a reasonable price.  I have only been using it for a few weeks now and the difference in the feel of my hair has been unbelievable - extremely soft!  In addition, the dryer is surprisingly quiet and dries my full head of hair in less time than my prior dryer.  Overall, I recommend this product.",11/7/2014

You can only choose High or Low speeds.  I totally missed those details in the online description that before my purchase.

I used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry. It took usually 45-50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair, which is just not long, thick and wavy: I have a lot of it, too (my stylist used to joke saying I had to heads in one, but sometimes another stylist would come to give her a hand... imagine to people pulling at your hair at the same time... it felt as if they were trying to split my head in two, sometimes!). My stylist is great, and became my great friend, but no matter how well she treated my hair, and how many conditioners, etc. I used, my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half, the natural waviness lost in an ugly way (the half of the hair closest to the roots, the other half wavy still... When I had my hair wet, it looked weird).<br /><br />One day I decided to get myself a blowdryer, and got the FHI 2000. Which turned out to be great, and while drying my hair with difficulty at first, because of my lack of practice, I managed. Seating in front of a mirror, I would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair. It was worth it! My hair changed a lot, and the huge amounts of money I used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary. Once I encountered my former stylist in the supermarket, and she thought I was visiting another beauty salon, she didn't believe me when I told her it was me (she didnt tell me, but from her face I could tell she didnt believe me).<br /><br />After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke. I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean). I did that, and regretted it a lot, since the repaired dryer damaged my hair. I had to condition it lots and lots afterwards, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback. After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!), I cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision! My sister tried it (she has wavy and think hair too), and immediately ordered one for her. I dry my daughter's and mother's hair too. The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great! I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.<br /><br />The Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage. It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me. I feel that since the blower is so fast, I can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long, thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime. For your info, I use all the buttons at full speed always. I can have my hair ready in 35-40 minutes.ds, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback.

And it looks kind of a cheap plastic.    However, this blow dries my hair pretty fast. So, it does what's required of it!    I took one star off because it does seem louder than your average hair dryer. If you live in a house, that's probably not a big deal; but if your apt has thin walls... you might not want to blow dry your hair in the middle of the night.    I really like the fact that the cord is retractable. Word of caution: hang on to the plug when you hit the retraction button because it will fly all over the place. And if you're not careful, this can probably hit you in the face because it retracts very fast.    Lastly, a couple reviews have mentioned that this Conair 1875 is heavier than most hair dryers.

It was fine so I moved it up to high/warm and continued. I used it for a minute before I heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in, the coils inside were turning red hot so I turned it off. About a minute later I turned it back on low to see if it was a fluke, the dryer started to hum quietly (not at the speed/sound it was just at when working properly) and then caught on fire! Smoke coming out of both ends, inside red hot and small flames. Needless to say it is unusable and I will be returning for a refund. I had it less than 24 hours and literally one use and it is gone.

I bought the Babyliss 3 in 1 diffuser with it so I've only ever used the two together. Before I get into the results, my first two thoughts when opening the box was that 1. The black is a beautiful deep matte color and the pink is a lot nicer on the product then in the picture and 2. It's a lot lighter than I expected. Everybody complained about how heavy it was. Again, I've never owned a hair dryer so maybe they're normally a lot lighter then this one. But from me, no complaints!<br /><br />And to the results... My hair is absolutely amazing now. Sometimes I'll just look at my hair in the mirror or even when a perfect curl falls on my shoulder and I'm just so happy. It's like it was styled and curled for hours to get it to look like that. It takes about 20 minutes to dry it completely and style it which sure beats the 4 hours it takes to air dry it. I put in some before products, lots of mousse and some gel and get to scrunching and by the end my hair is so full of volume and curls! And the best part is that my hair is still perfect for the next two days. Sometimes I'll rewet my hair and diffuse it for about 5 minutes to add more curl to it but then I'm good to go!<br /><br />I've never used the blow dryer to straighten my hair yet but if and when I do I'll review that. But for now I'm loving my curls!!",9/27/2014

I don't see how a dryer can be not heavy if it has good vibration damping and noise muffling, which this does.  I love the low noise level, as it is right by my ear, I've had enough of the loud flimsy light dryers in the past.  The only annoying thing is the buttons on the handle.  I have to be very careful when I move it around my head, it's easy to touch the buttons and change the settings unintentionally.  Also the head is LONG; I have long hair too, and I'm a tiny person.  Sometimes I grasp the blower part like pros do in salons, thank goodness for its low vibration.  Just that the beautiful silk finish gets oily from my hand that way.

The retractable cord works well and makes the dryer packable for travel. I've been happy with this dryer for 9 months until today.

It's got a more quiet engine but still dries fast and I love the retractable cord. I recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily, because the engines aren't super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life. Of course I've had my dryer for months now and it's all working great still, but if you have daughters or someone sharing it and they aren't careful when using it, or just using it too much, it will break eventually. Also- great tip for using the retractable cord- always pull the cord down at a casual pace, don't just yank it. Also, when pressing the button for it to go back in, what I do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button. It keeps from the plugin slapping everything in the area.",9/4/2014

I have used competitive designs in other motels, but find that this one is still the best, and is reasonably durable.  Based on my experience, I would guess that a unit is good for about 3,000 uses, at a cost therefore of about 1 cent per use (not counting the cost of electricity).  In addition to high  and low fan settings, It also has two power (heat) settings; 1200 Watts and 1500 Watts; I prefer the higher one. The unit is shipped with the 1200 Watt setting.  In order to set it to 1500 Watts, you must pry off the air intake cover to get to the hidden switch.  You can also hide almost any length of excess power cord in the raceway on the back of the unit.  You may need to experiment some and use some sharp U-turns to get the length just right for your situation. You should also pry off the air intake cover and vacuum out the air intake grill at least once each month to maintain good air flow, and to avoid tripping the overheat thermal protector. I use the little lever on a fingernail clipper as a pry rod.  It fits just right into the pry notch. I too liked the smaller and utilitarian design of the older model, but understand that most buyers prefer the ergonomic look of the new unit.  When you stored the older unit into a mechanical clip, it gave you an audible click to let you know that it was firmly in; the newer model uses a magnetic mount. You don't have to jam it in, but you do need to make sure the magnet has taken hold before you pull away your hand.",8/28/2014

Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute. And then yesterday when I turned it on, it sounded like it was going to explode. I really wanted this to last so much longer. Guess it's going in the electronic recycling bin.<br /><br />Sept 2015 Review: I've had this dryer for a year now and it's held up amazingly! The attachment I use is still attached and works great, and has never fallen off.<br />My only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now and I have to set it down after a few minutes. I have thick, wavy hair so it takes a little time to dry. Also, the handle (where my thumb holds the dryer) is starting the wear and there's a worn section. I'm still using this dryer, despite the handle getting over heated.<br /><br />Aug 2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall! Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers. I love all the attachments and the fact they don't fall off when you use them. I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten. Don't rely on all the reviews of &#34;too heavy&#34;, &#34;buttons wrong location&#34;, &#34;too loud&#34;, etc... Purchase and use, judge for yourself.

It does a great job of drying my thick, coarse and frizzy hair in a short period of time and without as much frizz as other hair dryers, even my previous Conair. I was pleasantly surprised that it is quite lightweight. My major concern with it is that the finger control to turn it on and to high, low and off is very cheaply constructed and designed. My previous Conair dryer was easy to maneuver with my thumb but this has been redesigned to look sleek but not have enough gripping surface, especially when you have hair produce on your hands. I often find myself using my opposite hand to try to nudge it upward and have almost broken the control off with my (short) fingernail in the process.

Buy $11 worth of lottery tickets, donate the $11 to charity, buy ice cream, anything else.... just don't waste your money on this junk!!!!!<br /><br />Honestly, I LOVED this little dryer for 6 weeks (just after the return period ended), now i have to throw it in the garbage!  The only issue i had with it (when it was working) was actually just an inconvenience/design flaw - as another reviewer said:  The buttons are on the inside of the handle and are the toggle style. You have to hold it just right so you don't turn it off or change the heat setting.<br /><br />THEN IT DIED - - -  DEAD, DEAD, DEAD!<br /><br />I was amazed that this hair dryer could sell for $11, it even comes with a diffuser and other accessories. I only used the dryer every other day for 6 weeks (so about 21 times) for about 5 - 10 minutes (max) each time...  I thought i was getting a cheap dryer, but overall it was VERY expensive:  If I bought a new $11 dryer every six weeks, that would be over $100/year - I could spend half that on a really nice hair dryer that would last years!<br /><br />The return policy expired but i could mail it to Conair ($12 postage) along with a check for $7.00 and then wait weeks for them to decide if they wanted to repair it or replace it (maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't).  So, then i would have $30 into a hair dryer that, if they choose to replace it, would be replaced with the same junk that would last another few weeks?????  I am not that stupid, I will cut my losses at $11.<br /><br />I know that so many other people have had the same problem with the short lifespan of this dryer -  i wish i had taken the time to read all the reviews.<br /><br />Conair & Amazon should stop selling these items, they know they are junk - that's why they offer them so cheap & that people are going to buy them because they are so cheap.  Conair doesn't have to worry that anyone would be stupid enough to take them up on their warranty (and flushanother $20 down the toilet) and Amazon, must figure that most of the dryers will work long enough that it isn't their problem!",7/25/2014

I was impressed at how powerful the HIGH speed setting was for a travel hair dryer.  Since I was headed to Europe I switched to 240 Volts and put it inside my suitcase. Once I arrived at my hotel I was very disappointed to find out, that once you switch to 240V you cannot flip the power switch to HIGH, you must try to dry your hair on the LOW setting which is no better than the hotel hair dryer. At first I thought it was just bad luck and went to try out my daughter's dryer ( I purchased two of these dryers since I was traveling with four teenage girls).  Their's did the same.  You can verify this at home, just put it on 240V and try to switch it to high with the dryer unplugged, you'll see that the switch won't move.  You can only go from OFF to LOW.

I bought this to replace my old Ionic 1875, which was on it's last legs from years of hard work. I am wishing that  I had bought a different dryer. The high setting is SO strong, and the medium would take a while to heat up to hot if I just started there. I can deal with this, but what I hate is the 'cool' touch button, which is supposed to hold your style and reduce frizzies. My last dryer did a great job with this feature, making my hair look smooth and shiny. But on this dryer, pushing this button is like going into a wind tunnel. Why would the makers kick the cool setting up to super-dooper-strong like the high setting? It blows your style to prices after you have just spent the time to create it!  I would have returned it if I could, but I bought it as back-up in case my old one broke, and too late by the time I actually opened it and tried it out. Thumbs down.",7/13/2014

The delivery was speedy and all the parts were included.  My adult son, who's good at assembling things, put it together for me.  I'm African-American with long Locs that I roll-up on curlers and my hair dried evenly at a comfortable setting.  I had to place thick cushions on my folding chair, which is somewhat low,  to sit high enough for my head to be covered under the dryer.  I wasn't able to adjust the height locking knob to lower the hood.  I'll have to call on my son again.  I love the convenience of giving my hair a deep heat conditioning, rinsing, rolling it on rollers, then drying it with my own professional bonnet style hood dryer.  My curls were soft and springy.  I've only used it once and so far so good for the price, timer and range of heat settings, size of the hood, ease of use, and aesthetics.",6/19/2014

However, this particular hair dryer I just bought in September 2013 to replace the previous hair dryer that was the same as this, but it was a different color.  It has worked perfectly well until the other day.<br /><br />I don't know if anyone else has ever had this experience ever!  I have sometimes left my dryer plugged into my outlet after blow drying my hair and this time was no different.  But after my last usage on Tuesday I became sick and paid no attention to the dryer laying on the counter in my bathroom.  But I kept smelling a sweet smell coming from the bathroom area and just thought it was my plug in freshener.  I had just bought a new insert.  But the next day I saw a puddle of red underneath my dryer and I saw that the area next to the plug reel up was melting!!  Really, does something like that happen.  I pulled the dryer plug immediately and put the dryer on a paper towel and it continued to seem to melt.  Red kept flowing from it for quite awhile.  This could have been a fire issue and something inside the dryer overheated.  I don't know.  But I do know I feel uncomfortable using it and threw it away and will have to purchase a new one.  To Conair ... shame on you for manufacturing such a shoddy piece of equipment!  If anyone be able to illuminate me on what happened or has experienced the same thing, please reply and let me know.  Oh and I gave this dryer 3 stars because it worked perfectly up until the melting.  In fact I'm upset that I won't get to continue using it, but I won't take the chance now.",6/19/2014

When I saw this one, I was pretty much mesmerized - not only did it come with attachments( including the diffuser), but it was pink and it a had button that would reel the cord in for you. When I got it though, did that remain true? Yes! the length of the cord might not be the longest but it isn't short either- it's a rather standard size I suppose. It works perfectly like any other blowdryer. I think the only reason I am putting four stars at this point is because after being so into the reeling feature , the reel started having problems about 2-3 months into owning the blowdryer. Was it serious? No, I can still push the cord into the blowdryer and everything is working fine. So if this isn't going to be a problem with you I'd recommend it. It was a good buy, and I ended up coming back and buying another one of these for a friend.",6/17/2014

It drives me crazy that manufacturers include OFF as a fan speed when in my mind, off is the lack of speed.<br /><br />Anyway, this hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for. I've been using it for a couple weeks now. I wanted to get some uses under my belt before I wrote a review. The review is long but I'm trying to cover all the topics.<br /><br />Fan Speeds:<br />High: It's a good high speed but not one that will blow you into the next room. I'd compare it to a high speed found on a good quality salon dryer.<br />Med: FINALLY!!! A real medium speed. I have very fine hair. It was hard for me to use 2 speed dryers because usually the low was too low and took forever to dry my hair and the high would make me look like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. The medium speed was enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time and allow me to style it.<br />Low: A reasonable low speed. Good for curly hair to keep it from frizzing.<br /><br />Heat Settings:<br />High: Certainly hot but not so much that it burned my fingers or scalp when drying.<br />Med: This is the setting I use most. It has enough heat to dry my fine hair quickly without causing it to look damaged.<br />Low: Nice to use for curls or a slower, more refined dry style.<br /><br />Noise level: Much quieter than I thought it would be. I have some more expensive dryers that I'd like to wear ear plugs with. Even my boyfriend commented on the lower sound.<br /><br />Buttons/Controls: Some people have commented on the stiffness of the slide adjustments. Are they stiff? A bit. But honestly, I'd rather them that way. The slide controls for the fan and heat are right where you are going to hold the dryer when using it. In my opinion, they need to be stiff so you don't move them accidentally when you are using the dryer. Nothing I hate more than drying my hair only to have my thumb hit a switch to high and blast myself on accident. I have arthritis in my hands and fingers but I don't find the slides hard to move. It just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down. The cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to.<br /><br />Attachments: It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment. Both function quite well. They snap in, so no falling off while you're using them. The push buttons used to detach are easy to push.<br /><br />As a whole:<br />This dryer is a fantastic buy! I'm going to order another one to keep as a back up. The cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it. The 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be. It doesn't get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won't blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book. The color seems pretty close to what is pictured on Amazon's site; it's nice, but I really didn't buy it for looks. It dries hair quickly and without causing frizz. There was no buyers remorse with this guy. It was well worth the time I spent looking and well worth the money I paid.switch to high and blast myself on accident.

I was unable to send it back to Amazon for an exchange but they told me to contact the manufacturer and that it was still on warranty! I did and Onei Beauty made it simple! I send it back to them and they'll send me another! Voila! Done! I'm not sure how long this product will last, but feel confident that the company will take good care of me should it happen again within a reasonable time frame! Because after all I REALLY LOVE THIS DRYER!!",6/5/2014

I would not invest in this as your every day dryer as you can get a better full-size dryer for the price but if you travel a lot, as I do, the voltage option is key. It's a lot heavier and bulkier than the typical travel hair dryer so I would not recommend this if you're looking for something small.

I don't use a blow dryer to style my hair, but rather to dry it after showering.  I have very thin, fine hair that dries quickly but easily gets frizzy and fly-away.  The hand dryer I've had for over 15 years did the job, but unless I used a leave-in conditioner before drying, my hair would often end up looking like shredded wheat.  Not attractive!<br /><br />So when it came time to buy a new dryer, I took a look at the ionic ones, which claim to leave hair soft and silky instead of frizzy and fly-away.  And since this one was so inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Well, it's fabulous!  When dried with this dryer, my hair actually feels silky.  And my hair has NEVER felt silky!  And to make things even better, that silkiness lasts between shampoos.<br /><br />I've read a few complaints here that the blower on this dryer isn't strong enough, or it doesn't get hot enough.  They may have a point -- the air emitted does seem to be less hot than my much older Conair.  But the blower seems strong enough for me.  My hair dries in about the same amount of time as it did with my old dryer.<br /><br />But what makes this so great isn't the heat or the amount of air, it's the ionic thing.  I don't know why it works, or how it works, but I love this thing, and the fact that it actually costs LESS than the one I bought fifteen years ago is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />It's a great dryer and it won't set you back much.

The main reason that I purchased this dryer was its price, practicality and its brand. Andis is one of the leaders in professional clippers in the hair industry, so I figured that I would give this dryer a shot. I have fine/normal curly just to about the ears, and this dryer gets it QUITE straight.I must admit that the &#34;high velocity&#34; air speed is not there, however, The HEAT is REALLY intense. As a professional, if I had to compare this to a standard salon dryer, performance wise, I would say that it acts a lot like the original Chi dryers, low speed, INTENSE heat, with ionic coating to break water molecules up faster. Now, that being said, if someone wants a dryer that really BLOWS the water out of the hair, I would recommend, concerning affordability and professional performance, the Babyliss 2800,  not that weighty and TRULY cuts drying time, in half, has a 3 year warranty AND Amazon sells it for half the retail price .<br /><br />This little Andis dryer works great for hair shorter than top of the shoulders, if you have really thick/curly or long hair, I would recommend use a T parting in your hair (draw a straight line with a wide toothed comb from the center of your eyebrows, to the back of your neck and comb each section down, from the very top of your head, draw a line from ear to ear to make a lower case 't' on your head) and do your hair in quadrants, (clipping them with butterfly clamps helps to keep other sections out of your way) 3-5 min extra prep time, but works WONDERS for straightening effectively, and saves you time in the end.<br /><br />This dryer does exactly what it says, it 'styles' hair, quite nicely might I add.The attachments are better than other vertical dryers that I have owned.The brush attachment is boar bristle, which allows one to naturally distribute oil through the hair, which is essential to a less frizzy and smoother blow dry. For those who have coarse, thick,tightly curled, or all of the above, use the comb attachment that best suits you, and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go, this will 'mold' your hair. Air cool the section that you are working on,The cool shot button on ANY dryer is almost useless, takes too long to cool, by the time it does, the section that you are working on is practically almost ready and is 'set'.<br />Overall, this is a four star dryer, it comes with a FIVE year warranty, it's very hot, and it is great for people (like me) who suffer from carp-tunnel and arthritis in their hands. At under twenty dollars, this is a great deal, it is nearly impossible to find one locally at that price, especially with a professional brand backing it. Thanks again Amazon, I find SO much great stuff here!r all of the above, use the comb attachment that best suits you, and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go, this will 'mold' your hair.

The Andis is more feature packed (see my separate review). The Conair is a bit quieter than most hair dryers I've owned including the Andis model. I used a db digital sound meter to measure the difference, the Conair was only 76db vs. 83db from the Andis model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers. The Conair is packed with 1875 watts which is more than enough to dry long thick hair. There are 2 heat settings (low & high) and a cool setting. The cool setting is the same temperature as when using the cool shot button (no heat at all). The air intake on the back is a 1-3/4 inch round opening covered by a removable lint screen. The opening is a bit small when compared to the Andis model which is larger at 2-3/8 inches and has side air intakes as well. This begs the question of reliability of the Conair because overheating of the motor is a prone problem of all hair dryers and with a small air intake opening on the Conair model, this could cause more heat build up of the motor. Only time will tell. The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility. The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models. Air temperature at maximum is 162 degrees on the Conair and 198 degrees on the Andis using a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached, all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory. The retractable cord is nice and measures 5 feet + 3 inches with 5-1/2 inches that does not retract into the handle. The retracter is a bit stronger than the Andis model but it will still require you to help feed the cord all the way to its end. The dryer does come with a 3 year warranty but the Andis model comes with a generous 5 year warranty. Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same.  My favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design & feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design & feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.",4/25/2014

Had to get it from Target. It works great - pleased with the feel, dual voltage for travel, etc. Like the button that allows you to control the cooling on the high fan setting. Powerful blower in that little motor. However, after we ordered what we thought was the same through Amazon, it turned out that the color is not the only thing different on this unit from the black one by Conair. This unit is louder and feels cheeper. I recommend the black unit that looks identical to this one except that the cooling button is on the back side of the unit. The only number I could find on the black unit was D167S - that may be an older version of the Conair &#34;Folding Handle&#34; dryer on the Conair website - Model: 124TL.

It cuts my drying time literally in half, so who cares? The 'cool shot' button works really well which was also a huge plus for me. This dryer has a cartridge that is very easy to remove hair from so that it won't fail as easily. Overall, it's a solid product and I've been very happy with mine.<br /><br />Side Note: Conair will replace within four years if this breaks if you call them, which sealed the deal for me for a $30 dryer.

Secondly, I have used the same Revlon Ionic $15-20 blowdryer since I was about 16years old and never had any problems with it. I always repurchased the same one maybe once every 6years or so.<br /> My hair is naturally curly but its slowly lost most of its curl through the years and been left with a good amount of volume and wave. My hair had always gotten pretty frizzy when I blew it dry but I just figured that was part of the drying process. One day while at work I was looking at a T3 and discussing how my hair frizzes, i was told that with the new hair dryers and such that this isnt what should be happening and that i should get a new high end hair dryer. I researched many of the new T3 and the Drybar products only to be pretty disappointed considering the price. I actually bought a T3 and had problems with the end staying on it and the location of the switch and my hand. I had found the Elchim but was skeptical of it bc of the name in general. I wasnt a big name brand and no one i talk to had ever heard of it. After ONE use I could tell a huge difference. It doesnt dry my hair any faster though. I dont have any frizz and it is smoother, smells better, not to hot to touch, and a lot more shine!

She has fine hair that lacks body.  As I researched dryers I read that people with fine hair will get better volume & body if they don't use NEGATIVE Ion dryers but instead use NEUTRAL Ion dryers.  The price on the MK-II was about $30 more than the TT3000 (which she liked) but I thought that with all the 5 star comments (i.e. lighter weight, quieter, 4 yr warranty, etc.) it was worth it, especially since it had a Negative/Neutral Ion switch.  When it came I mentioned all of its advantages to her.  I was crushed when her first comments were:<br />1. Yes, its quieter than the TT3000 but that's because on high fan the air volume was equal to the low fan speed of the TT3000.<br />2. No, the neutral Ion setting didn't give her any more body/volume than the TT3000 did.<br /><br />It is 2.5 ounces lighter than the TT3000 (according to our digital postage scale) and she's OK with it's performance so I'm not sending it back but I wished I'd just gotten another TT3000 and saved the $30.  Maybe a $180 unit with neutral Ion's would give her more volume but I do know that if this one breaks I'm not buying another MK-II.  Sure wished someone would have posted a comment like this one so I didn't waste my money.  Personally, I like the build quality of the TT3000 also.",3/13/2014

It was great for easy storage and my storage space is limited and cramped.  After years though, that blow dryer died and I needed to replace it.  I always go with Conair because they make a trusty, yet inexpensive, product.  I chose this one because of the retractable cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage.  I figured that if the retracting cord helped with storage, the folding handle has to be even better, right?  Plus, I'm traveling internationally this year, so I thought the folding handle would be good for a suitcase and the dual voltage would be good for international power conversion.  While I had high hopes for his blow dryer, it has really been nothing but disappointing...<br /><br />The blow dryer itself works great, like any other Conair I've owned.  The retracting cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage switch, however, do not.  The joint on the folding handle is quite flimsy.  The top of the blow dryer wobbles a bit back and forth and I'm sure this will only get worse over time.  This feature doesn't seem built to last.  The retractable cord also doesn't retract.  It gets stuck halfway through and still leaves about a foot and a half of cord sticking out of the end of the blow dryer.  It's not a huge deal since the blow dryer still works, but it is definitely irritating since I bought the blow dryer specifically for this feature.  I don't know for sure, but in my opinion, I think the retractable cord doesn't work right because of the folding handle.  It just seems like that whole area is made flimsy and I think the cord is getting stuck inside the blow dryer near the joint of the handle.  And finally, the dual voltage switch--I can't, for the life of me, get that thing to switch over.  I've tried using my acrylic nails, a screwdriver, my boyfriend, etc. and nothing has worked.  Unless you're traveling with Thor, I wouldn't count on this feature.  Luckily I have a power converter for other electric items, so I can use that with the blow dryer...if it makes it that long.  I may chuck the thing out a window next week!<br /><br />If anybody is interested in the Conair blow dryer I had prior to this one, it was the Conair YOU Cord Reel 2-in-1 Hair Dryer.

It's waist length, and thick. I used a plastic Conair Ion Shine 1875 hair dryer prior to buying this one. I could dry my hair with the Conair in maybe 15-20min. With the Remington, I can dry my hair in 5-10min! As for the less frizz the pearl ceramic plate is supposed to deliver, I think my hair is less frizzier... I have no idea if this is because of that, or because this dryer can sustain heat and air flow well enough to straighten my hair better.<br /><br />The colors are a bit off from the product image. The removable cap on the back of the dryer is a darker shade of pink, while the buttons and the ceramic plate are a lighter pink (but the product image's pink is a lot lighter). The unit itself is a dark maroon or purple-ish sort of color. It's not black. The material is not plastic. It has an interesting finish... smooth but doesn't slide around on a marble countertop like plastic does). The entire hairdryer is a bit heavier than I'm used to, but it's not too much of a big deal as long as you keep your hairdryer steady and you don't swing it about. Since it dries my hair in just a few minutes, the weight really isn't an issue. The cord is a decent length, but I use this at the sink, so I don't need a very long cord.<br /><br />I like the extra heat so I always have my heat set to the third level. The second level is probably better for finer hair. My hair is thick, so I like more heat. The first level is only slightly warm. It's just slightly warmer than the cold shot setting.<br /><br />As for the air speeds... I also like to use the highest setting. The second highest setting is just as fine, but if I'm in a rush, I blast the settings to dry my hair quickly. The air flow is very strong, so with finer hair, you're probably better off at a lower setting here as well. I noticed that other reviews have said they actually keep the hairdryer about 8in from their head to avoid burns. Just to give you a better understanding of my hair, I use the highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in. So much hair, and I like it long.<br /><br />Overall, hairdryer is heavy, but the heat and the air speed is fantastic for anyone with a lot of hair that's thick and long. Saves me time in the morning when getting ready, and my hair isn't as frizzy. Bonus points: After placing my order, I received this unit the next morning.

Also this hair dryer is much quieter than older models similar to this one.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone who hates long drying times.  It gets the job done and it gives your hair a natural shine.,3/8/2014

I wanted it because I really like the &#34;hot comb&#34; style.  After receiving it and noting the similarities with my old unit I would bet that Andis manufactured the dryer for Vidal Sassoon.  Not only was the design almost identical, but the comb and brush attachments were identical and, in fact, would interchange perfectly with my old unit.  If that is the case, this one should also last for many trouble free years.  It does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion.  The unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds.  The fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything.  A check with my ammeter revealed, however, that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position.  I am not saying that this is any kind of a problem, but I just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds.<br /><br />I would personally question the part about the &#34;ionic&#34; feature &#34;breaking up water molecules&#34; to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do.<br /><br />At any rate, it was just what I was looking for and does a great job.",2/25/2014

I am a black woman with natural hair (absolutely no chemicals nor weave) and my hair is more susceptible to dryness and breakage.  Therefore, it is extremely important for me to be extra sensitive and mindful to the type of products I use on my hair. This dryer did not pull my hair out, no burnt smell and I didn't mind the sound quality, afterall it is a hair dryer not a fan. The only negative I have is that the buttons can easily be depressed while blow drying your hair.  So you may have to double check a few times as I did to make certain you are using the right temperature on your hair.  Here is a tip I learned, when planning on using hot curlers, flat irons etc. please cool your hair down first (the cool shot button truly does help)and use a non-buildup non-oily heat treatment.  The more natural and/or organic the better. Wait at least 10 minutes or longer before proceeding to styling. Heat from the dryer with immediate usage of other heat sources can cause stress and unnecessary damage (or more damage) to your scalp and hair.

That's exactly what I wanted and that's what I got. This hairdryer, with the airflow concentrator attachment, dried my hair in under 7 minutes, which is unheard of for me. It has 3 heat settings, 2 fan speeds, and a cool air shot button.<br /><br />BONUS: This hair dryer is quieter than a lot of others I've owned. It's still a hair dryer, so it'll make noise, but this one's noises are hushed.<br /><br />Besides its speedy drying, it's just a really pretty hair dryer. It's got an attractive black matte finish that's soft to the touch. It also features pretty pink pearlescent buttons and accents.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I recommend this hair dryer to those who are looking for a quiet, yet powerful hair dryer to streamline their morning routine.",2/14/2014

But, the use of toggle switches for power and temperature right on the handle instead of a sliding switch seems like poor planning at best.  Every time I change hand positions I'm accidentally turning it off or moving it from hot to warm.  The only way to avoid doing that is to not put your hand around the inside of the handle - I've dropped the dumb thing on the floor more times than I can count while trying to avoid turning it off!  All other dryers I've ever used have switches that slide up or down and only move when you want them to, not just if you accidentally touch it.

You won't regret this purchase,"This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.<br /><br />When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn't justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)…so I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I've loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. But…I still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)<br />I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!<br /><br />So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it's the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.<br />Now I admit, I don't know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry's new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &#34;favorite dryer.&#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.<br /><br />I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.<br /><br />On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.<br /><br />The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.<br /><br />I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.<br /><br />Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It's also color treated.<br /><br />So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it's expensive it's totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot. I'm thrilled with mine.r / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days.

I explained that hair dryers can't simply be plugged into an adapter. You need a complicated, often expensive, voltage converter that can handle the power draw of a high wattage appliance.<br /><br />I figured for the price of a converter we could likely just find a 220v hair dryer and then rather than carry her giant hair dryer, AND a bulky converter, we'd just have one compact device.<br /><br />As it turns out, we stayed in several hotels, and ALL OF THEM had hair dryers in them. We didn't need to bring anything at all. Moreover, this one is pretty weak, and the ones in the hotels tended to be much better.<br /><br />So my advice is this: if you're going to Europe, don't bother buying and packing a hair dryer. Just use the one in the hotel. And if you should happen to find yourself in a hotel that doesn't have one, you can probably buy something better than this one for about the same money while you're there, and you'll have saved yourself the hassle of packing it.",1/24/2014

I had to go to the shop and drill out the holes bigger. This took several trips as I wanted to make sure they weren't too big so the small screw head would just go through the hole.

I'm so glad I did! I have super thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years. I'm not sure why I never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference, but I really wish I had figured it out sooner! I learned this lesson a few years ago when it comes to hair straighteners; I have the T3 Mane Tamer that I absolutely adore. So, I started there. T3 has a few different dryers, all with positive ratings, and all VERY expensive. I wasn't convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much. I read through tons of reviews for this Onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price. It arrived quickly and I couldn't wait to get it out of the box and use it! Normally, I spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry--not blowing it out, not using any brushes or styling tools/techniques, just getting it dry so that I can use my flat iron. The result (before flat ironing) is what I like to call my &#34;white girl afro&#34;--it is big, it is fluffy and it is crazy!<br />After reading some reviews and Q&As, I switched on the negative ion button, got my round brush and went to town. I could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry. My technique was sadly out of practice and I did end up using my flat iron on a few spots, but I think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice. I really believe that, once I get used to blowing my hair out again, I will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron required!!<br />My hair was so smooth and VERY shiny in the end, I was so happy with it. The dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use and I love all the options it has with heat/cool, fan speed, etc. The buttons are perfectly located for my taste, not in the way at all and no risk of accidentallypushing buttons while using. I also love that there is both a cool shot (if you just need a quick blast of cool air) and a cool temperature setting (for when you want cool air for an extended period of time). I was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is. When I first turned it on, it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet and I was afraid it wouldn't be very powerful, but that is definitely not the case--plenty of power without all the noise.<br />I am very, very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it.",1/8/2014

Pull the Conair 225NP from the holster, point it at the hair and get started.  The powerful DC fan moves lots of air to force its way into that mop head of hair and push the water out.  The three heat settings provide complete control over the speed of the drying process.  The entire band can share one 225NP and still be on the stage in time to rock the house!<br /><br />Medium heat and high speed fan gets hair dry fast with no friz.",12/25/2013

This hairdryer Is 3 speed so the wiring Is more complicated than In the Vidal Sassoon. I have taken this hairdryer apart to clean and lubricate It, I take the back part off which has a metal screen Inside run In under the faucet with hot Water then I spray WD-40 In the motor doing that It will probably last forever. It has of get to burn out the fuse which I have bypassed a few times on the Vidal Sassoon but apparently there seems to be a piece  of plastic under to button to the switch which I lost taking It apart I put It back together and It worked right but had to use a small screw driver to turn In on and off with so I tried to modify It so that I did Not have to use a small screw driver now only high setting works. I have taken other hairdryers apart and could Not hardly put them back together this hairdryer goes back together fairly easy but It being 3 speed If You break some wires I do Not even want to think about It. I use hairdryers for many things as thawing out Water lines, defrosting the Freezer, defrosting the windshield on My Truck, pre heating the cab, dry out socks and shoes, putting under blanks when Its very cold this hairdryer has a round back which helps keep stuff from blocking off the Air flow and I have had hairdryers to burn out because of having a flat back and fall In to a chair with a blanket and burn out, and this hairdryer has a good automatic heat switch which prevents It from over heating but do Not ever leave a hairdryer under the blanket while You are sleeping or Not there.",12/16/2013

I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn't work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.

Worth the $$$.,"OMG I love this dryer.  I have thick short hair and asked my stylist what dryer to get next.  I had a cheap drugstore one that had lasted years but was on its last legs.  I have really hesitated to spend a ton of money on a dryer but went ahead and bought this since my birthday was coming up.  I read the reviews before completing the transaction and thought the people who said it dries their hair faster must be crazy.  How would one dryer dry hair significantly faster than another?<br /><br />The answer is I don't know, but it does.  It absolutely does.  I am a convert!  I LOVE this dryer.  I love how small it is.  I packed it on a trip recently and didn't have to stress about how much room it took up in my suitcase.  It is so compact and powerful.  I just adore it.<br /><br />I'm not great at reviewing products I feel strongly about so the fact that I'm even writing this should tell you something.  This dryer really is different than other dryers out there and the higher price is worth every penny.  When you can shave time off of your morning routine every single day, imagine how much of your life you get back?  Now, is that worth extra money?  I am a wash and go girl with little to no interest in makeup, fashion, etc.  I am a mom of three and own a small quilting business.  But I wash my hair every day and have to dry it to tame it.

Every time I went to a hotel, I wrote down the brand with the intention of ordering one. Finally my old blow dryer went kaput, so I had an excuse to purchase this one.<br /><br />First of all, I don't know why the photo shows it somewhat pearly looking: it's plain old white. Second, it was a bit larger than I expected and so it wouldn't fit in the spot I had chosen for it. I ended up having to mount it above a towel bar since if it was below it would either be in the way of the light switches or it would have to under the hand towels and make an odd bulge. So I put it in myself--didn't use the anchors as I think it will stay in place without. I hung a little picture next to it so it wouldn't look so out of place above the towel bar by itself.<br /><br />It works just as expected and I love having it ready to go whenever I am. One advantage I discovered with mounting it higher is that it's never going to get caught on knobs or anything else--a frequent frustration when I'm tired in the morning. We had our first really cold day here (in the South) and I found it's also handy for warming yourself up quickly when coming out of the shower; I've suggested it to my husband for that purpose (he's bald and otherwise wouldn't need it).<br /><br />I'll update my review if I ever have problems with it, but so far it's great--just have to get used to seeing it there on the wall.",11/14/2013

Aren't they all the same?  Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  It seems a simple thing -- just turn it on and dry the hair -- but I've been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong, blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting, too weak, barely putting out a cough of air, or too cold, or too hot, or that just fry themselves after a few months of use.  And, specifically, I wanted a travel hair dryer, since my last supposed &#34;dual voltage&#34; hair dryer went up in smoke (literally!) when trying to use it on the other voltage setting.  So, this hair dryer has been a welcome treat.  Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &#34;cool shot&#34; at either voltage setting.  Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  Comes with two attachments, as shown, handle folds, plus the back opens up for cleaning!  I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!

If you are the type of person who just flips the hair around and smooths with fingers, this might be too much dryer for you, but I have no experience with that kind of hair. This is my first professional hair dryer, and I couldn't be happier. I have medium coarse hair (mixed race, ringlets, coarse but not kinky. 3b maybe?) that is currently just below chin length. I'm super-skeptical about product claims, so I did a lot of research. I read an article about a comparison of several models that convinced me of the effectiveness of titanium, and I knew I wanted 2000 watts just cause I wanted as much power as possible. There aren't too many dryers with those 2 features, so after reading the positive reviews, I decided on this model. From the first time I used it, I was very pleased. My hair was definitely softer and smoother. I never believed a hairdryer could make your hair softer, but this one definitely did. I can also dry my hair much more quickly, but I think that is because with this hair dryer, I am actually able to dry my hair like the hairdresser does (in big sections, using the curve of my head to smooth it out.) Previously, I always had to dry my hair in 1-2inch sections wrapping around and pulling with a round brush, which takes FOREVER. If I dry my hair that way with this dryer, it still takes about as long, but I don't really get much better results so I don't bother. CONS: 1. I still have to use a flat iron to smooth my ends. For the life of me, I can't get smooth ends with a hair dryer. I was really hoping this dryer would solve that for me, but instead it has convinced me that it is my technique, not the dryer. 2. It really does get HOT. I have to use medium heat around the edges of my hairline, and that can still be a little intense. If you have a sensitive scalp, this might be too much dryer for you. 3. The nozzles seem kinda cheap. My last hair dryer had  nozzles that snapped on, which made it easier to rotate and change the angle. These nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when I try to rotate them. I can't speak to some of the other complaints about this dryer like weight and noise. I wouldn't call this dryer light or quiet, but it doesn't seem particularly loud or heavy to me. Personally, I wouldn't want to give up the performance of this dryer for those features.<br /><br />Hope this review helps, and happy styling everyone!",10/29/2013

Usually the concentrator is fine for this but it'd be nice to have a bit more flow.<br /><br />The diffuser is also very nice. I've never really used a diffuser until getting this but it generally keeps my thick, curly hair frizz free as long as I don't dry it completely. If I dry it 100%, then I definitely get some frizz on the top layer of my hair.<br /><br />Overall, very happy with this product for the price.",10/25/2013

I had to pay $15 in shipping to return it to them. I think that's totally bogus, given that the unit shouldn't have had ANY problems in that timeframe. Hopeful, I sent it along. In about three weeks, they sent me another dryer--same model.<br /><br />Having used the only other dated dryer I had in the house during that three weeks, I can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally. I recall now why I I loved the predecessor of this dryer, and this one, before it became problematic. It's quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it's well-vented and easily cleaned. Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly. They fall off this one--the one from the deceased predecessor, and the one that came with this replacement. It's virtually no use to me without the attachments.<br /><br />But honestly, I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last. That it works well is only part of what makes a product great. Longevity is part of the equation, as well.I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last.

Anyways, I received this dryer on Saturday which was the day it was supposed to arrive. I had missed the delivery, but I was so anxious to get it that I went to FedEx and picked it up. I ordered this along with the Denman Brushes Thermo Straightening Brush (D79) . So I am Black and I have 4b natural hair. I had been trying to straighten my hair for the longest. I also recently purchased a Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium 1.5-inch Steam Styler off of overstock.com, which I like way better than the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch I also purchased last year.<br /><br />So the whole point is, I really like this hair dryer so far. I wish I could have got the blue one but it cost almost $11 for shipping which made it not worth it. The color is very vibrant. O yea the main thing is, the dryer dries my hair very quickly.

I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.

This one is the nice true compact type I like.  It also has decent quality of wire (some of that cheap wire nowadays hardly bends), and the cord is a generous 6 feet. The long cord is also a big selling point since a lot of the newer dryers have 4 foot cords.  I cannot comment on the international power settings since this will probably only be used in North America.  It does have 2 separate blowing speeds. The high speed is good, but my older dryer is just a little more powerful.  However, this one is good enough and the controls are set up for easy one-handed usage, with high, then &#34;off&#34; then &#34;low&#34; all on one simple power button. My hands are arthritic and this is much easier button placement than having the buttons on the front of the handle.  Also has a hanging loop as shown in the photo and I will be using that rather than folding the cord up after each use to store it.  Overall, this feels like a high quality product and over the past month or so I have used it, has been excellent.  I would buy it again, and no stupid folding handle to try and get &#34;compact&#34; rating.",7/3/2013

I was able to buy those (the old ones) at the big W (you know where) for a reasonable price, but they would die about every 6 to 12 months. When the last one died, they didn't have any on the shelf (go figure). So I tried to find a replacement with this one.<br /><br />It's a shiny red color, but since it spends most of it's life in the cabinet under my sink, I don't think that's a big selling point. I like that this one has a retracting cord, and the fact that it doesn't fold in half like my old ones hasn't been a problem, so far. In fact, it's probably an engineering upgrade. I imagine the folding types break more easily.<br /><br />When I first started using it, it seemed to take a bit longer than average to dry my hair, but after a few uses, it seems to be &#34;broken in&#34; now. I like that it has cold, warm or hot options and low or high speeds. So, all in all, it does the job for a reasonable price and offers the retractable cord (which is a must for those of us who a bit OCD). Only gave it 4 stars because, well, it's not made of gold (which would probably melt from the heat anyway).",6/18/2013

It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers), my hair doesn't require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it's actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).

I like the cool blower for finishing when the day is hot. I keep pressing the cool shot button accidentally, however, because it's so darn convenient. The cool shot button is exactly where my thumb naturally rests and I have to keep that in mind. The cord is shorter than I'd like, and a good bit shorter than my last dryer. The sliding controls aren't wonderful. The friction ridges are quite flat and the two slides mesh so well and are so narrow that my thumb can't tell them apart. I have to press those flat ridges so hard that it hurts my thumb, so I use my &#34;off&#34; hand to slide the controls. There's some kind of thin, plastic-like finish that's slowly peeling off, but that doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />My last dryer was a Black & Decker. It was very small and compact and did the job for many years, possibly as much as 20 years. I do still wish I could have replaced it with the same thing.<br /><br />All this sounds like complaining, I know, but they're trivial complaints (except the cord length). I've never had a diffuser attachment before but I found it worth learning to use. I used to dry and style my short, curly hair in about a minute on the hot setting, but now the diffuser and the warm setting do it just as fast and better. The Conair hot setting is pretty hot, so if you need that you'll be happy. Best of all is that, even in the winter, my hair never gets flyaway with static electricity.<br /><br />I've had this Conair less than a year, so I can't comment on its durability.<br /><br />BTW, I bought this upon the recommendation of Consumer Reports.

On the bright side, this won't burn your hair & will dry without damaging your hair.  Personally, I like it.  Hubby complains, because he wants to turn on the dryer, sweep it over his head about 6 times and be finished.  No go.  What used to take him a minute now takes 3.  But I think his hair looks healthier.  He could care less : )  He's a man on a mission and wasted time frustrates him to no end.  Patience is a virtue, I say, as he rolls his eyes.<br /><br />It has two speeds (I use low).  It was easy to install; I did it myself in about 3.5 minutes (really easy).  You use 2 screws to screw a small metal plate onto the wall in your desired hanging location, within reach of an electrical outlet.  Then just clip the dryer body onto the plate, plug in, and DONE!<br /><br />The design's great, because the dryer can continue to cool, even after you hang it up, so you don't have to pre-cool it or worry about it overheating in its stand.  It has a nice little blueish-white nightlight built in, a pleasant plus.<br /><br />Would I buy it again?  Absolutely.  Do I recommend it?  Wholeheartedly for short haircuts.  I like it!",5/25/2013

This hairdryer--maybe even more than the previous model--leaves my hair especially smooth and sleek. It dries hair quickly, and the concentrator attachment really works well so that you can put the dryer right next to your brush. My two complaints are related to the retractable cord function: 1) The dryer is heavier than a usual dryer because of the cord reel, and 2) The cord is not very long, maybe only 3&#34;. Neither of these things may be a problem for you. If you specifically WANT a retractable cord, the extra weight is worth it, otherwise, it's just extra weight. And if you don't need a long cord, if your outlet is right next to your mirror for instance, the short cord is no big deal. But just keep these things in mind",5/20/2013

It's easy to install, and handy as all get out.

The handgrip started heating up as I held it, and when I tried to turn it off, the switch was frozen completely and it continued to overheat even more. Since it had taken on a life of its own, I had to unplug the unit and un-install the whole thing. This is a great concept for a hairdryer--it can't be beaten for convenience while still being stowed out of the way when not in use. Granted, an appliance that retails for less than $30 can be expected to not last forever, but I've owned hand-held hairdryers that wouldn't quit for years and years.

The amount of 'hair static' effect seems reduced vs. my previous hairdryer.  The unit is a bit heavier than I expected, but the weight is balanced so handling is fine.  It's quieter than I expected even at full speed.  The cord is longer than needed in my personal situation, I find a cord that long just gets in the way.  The cord is straight, not coiled.  The big block thing at the end of the cord (vs. just an AC power plug) I find a nuisance since my power outlets are already GFCI-type outlets. Basic controls are fan & heat: 2 fan speeds + off & 2 temperatures + off.  The number of temperature settings advertized is a bit misleading - (&#34;4 temperatures&#34; is actually achieved by a combination of temperature switch & fan switch settings.)  Instructions (for English anyway) are generally lacking, but with a bit of experimentation one can figure out how to work it.  I rate the dryer 4 stars primarily for these reasons:  The &#34;Removeable stainless filter&#34; is a nice feature so hair clogs on the inlet can be removed, but getting it all back in place is not easy, it takes careful manipulation because the parts are not finely fitted and they bind easily (at least on my unit.)  Because of the binding and poor fit, I was afraid of breaking something in the precess of putting it back together after cleaning the filter.  The ad says: &#34;Includes concentrator&#34; - I assume this is supposed to be an attachment to put on the nozzle, my unit did NOT come with any extra parts.  All things considered I think it's overpriced and in some ways the ad is misleading.  I do intend to keep it, but will shop around again if I ever need another.",5/13/2013

First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm. Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted. I figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big, so I set out to find one that was narrower. This dryer works perfectly.

I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  Well, the retracting mechanism worked perfectly once or twice.  After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  After a couple months of that silliness, it now won't retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior started.<br /><br />Do you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70's?  You know the ones.. they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you'd struggle?  You'd pull it a tiny bit and hope it'd release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it'd pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair dryer!<br /><br />Other observations:<br />- The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.<br />- The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  Same goes for the heat.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.  It just frustrates me so much that I had to do it just in the hope that I might save someone else the trouble of experiencing this thing.",5/2/2013

So now I had a criteria for research:  Something that was quiet and didn't blow my hair into a limp state.  That's what lead me to this Remington.  It shipped and got here quickly.  Yes, it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used, but I was impressed.  It was easy to handle.  I liked that I didn't have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer.  It was relatively quiet as hair dryers go.  The drying process went very quickly.

This dryer gets my thick hair completely dry and frizz-free in under 3 minutes.  I use product and a round brush and have been very pleased with this dryer.  It is quiet and doesn't get too hot.  I love the adjustable heat and speed settings.  I also use the concentrator attachment to channel the air.  I was unable to find this product at any local retailers (Walmart and Target are the two I checked) and i think it is better than the Conair Infinity X pro model.

Unless you really want a cord-keeper dryer or have already chosen the ~$30 price point, I might look around more before settling on this one. However, it does the job and I'm going to keep it. Personally, I wish I hadn't been so desperate and had spent a little more time looking, but I'm also willing to spend a little (or a lot) more money for something I won't want to replace later.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* cord-keeper - no tangled cords!<br />* good wattage - fast dry<br />* tourmaline does soften hair - noticeable, but subtle<br /><br />Cons:<br />* heavy - I like to hold the dryer vertically above my head and it's significantly heavier than a non-tourmaline.<br />* large - this is above average in size, don't think you're going to travel with it.<br /><br />Some low-star reviewers mentioned the finish coming off on their hands, and I'd just like to clarify that is a random flaw in their dryers. I have porcelain skin and use this on the highest setting for about 20-30 minutes and have not seen any finish come off - so if you're worried about that, it's not the norm.<br /><br />As far as this being a tourmaline dryer, it's an upgrade from non-tourmaline; the technology used dries the water on your hair and you should see less heat damage.

One problem.,"This is a fast, powerful hair dryer. I have medium length, medium thick hair and this little number works fast without over-drying. The problem? The plug is too loose in the socket. This is the same socket I've used for several different curling wands, straighteners, hair dryers, battery chargers and even Glad plug-ins over the last eight years. The plugs on all those items fit the outlet just fine. The plug on this dryer will fall right out of the socket six or seven times in the five or six minutes it takes to dry my hair. VERY frustrating! I usually sit a heavy book about 8 inches out on the cord to hold it steady then shove a vase against the plug to keep it in the socket. Of course, this leaves very little cord length for raising the dryer up to my head since the cord is already a bit short.",4/11/2013

The product is wonderful when it works but my Amazon order history shows it is a consistent failure (purchases on Jan 3, 2012, Mar 5, 2013, May 20, 2013, Jun 19, 2017) of the same feature. There was at least one other failure but I complained directly to the manufacturer about the short lifespan in 2013 and was sent a new one and also bought another new one at a local store and these two lasted 4 years, 2013-2017.<br /><br />Some people may ask why I keep buying this product and I will say, 1) it is inexpensive, 2) a few of these units have lasted for more than one year, 3) the 3 holes on my bathroom wall where it is mounted are difficult to disguise and each replacement unit so far has fit into these holes (although I now use a slightly larger drywall anchor) and, 4) I like having a hair dryer off my counter!<br /><br />Original comment: I purchased this hair dryer more than a year ago and used it nearly every day to dry both my husband's and my own short hair.  It is a reasonably quiet but powerful machine that does its job well.  The addition of a hanger on the wall mount to wrap the cord out of harms way, since it inevitably stretches out, is a great innovation.  I would have given it a 5-star review then.<br /><br />Unfortunately the lower speed (it has two speeds) stopped functioning after a little more than a year. The higher speed is too hot and too noisy to use.  I repurchased the exact same hair dryer on April 6, 2013.  Today--3 days AFTER the 30-day product replacement window--the lower speed stopped functioning.<br /><br />Updated 7/14/15:  The manufacturer replaced this hair dryer under their more customer-friendly policy but I had already bought a new one from Amazon so I stored it away.  Last week, more than two YEARS later, the new Amazon hair dryer quit (same reasons as before) and I was able to install the stored dryer in 10 minutes.  I urge Amazon customers to always consider invoking the manufacturer's warranty and remind everyone that being able to reprint the Amazon purchase record provides &#34;proof of purchase&#34; they needed to honor their own 1-year warranty.  I also  am upgrading this product to 4 stars because it continued to perform well for longer than many inexpensive electrical appliances these days and, obviously, I like the style and functionality enough to keep buying the same unit<br />I won't purchase a third one.

Both of these hair dryers are made by Helen of Troy. Both have the same handle, body, and heat/speed options.  Both have the exact same Intertek number (3175842).

Here are my impressions:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Doesn't get as hot, but dries my hair in about the same amount of time as my old (non-ceramic, non-ionic) hairdryer (if anything, a little faster). Lower heat is less damaging to my hair, so since this dryer still gets it done just as quickly, that's a good thing in my book!<br />- Has three heat settings and two intensity settings, allowing for lots of control.<br />- Has a cold shot button that functions well.<br />- Retractable cord is very convenient for traveling and storage.<br />- Design is sleek and attractive.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I wish the cord were just a little longer. Maybe I'm asking for too much, but this one seems a little shorter than my last, and I find myself pulling on it fairly often.<br />- The hairdryer is a bit heavy, but nothing unmanageable. Get that arm workout!<br /><br />I haven't used the diffuser or concentrator attachments, so I can't give an accurate review of those.

She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We've never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.

I'm very happy to have purchased it as it has changed the texture of my hair tremendously. I never knew how much a blow dryer can have such an effect to the results of your hair. My hair is so smooth, soft, and shiny. I use to dread blow drying my hair and instead forfeited it altogether. I would only blow dry on special occasions and preferred air drying because I have very long and thick hair so it would take my full hair to dry 30-45 minutes and even then there would be spots still damp, my hair would get caught in the vent, it was EXTREMELY hot under the blow dryer....basically it was more of a hassle to blow dry my hair. With the T3 it is so pleasant and 10 times quicker to dry. I love the efficiency and ease the T3 provides as well as the amazing results.<br /><br />I had my mother try my dryer out so she could feel the difference and she was instantly converted. She commented she never knew that a blow dryer could make such a difference. [We are use to buying cheaper dryers because we didn't think a more expensive dryer made a difference.] This is a great investment and what a deal you get from purchasing on Amazon. I see the T3 dryers on sale at TJ Maxx periodically but it is still no way near the deal I got on Amazon. Right away I bought one for my mother [per her request] and we can gladly say we have never looked back!",4/5/2013

I need a decent dryer to handle my long hair. Hotel dryers are always pretty cheap, and my old mini travel was useless. T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size. You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume. The only difference between the Travel and Full size is that the Travel drying times are a bit longer. It also comes with a little travel pouch, as an added bonus.<br /><br />You can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one (which normally runs $200, and you really have to wait out the sales). It works better than a typical semi-professional dryer in the same price range (works better than my old Tool Science dryer, which was about $60).<br /><br />My favorite thing about the T3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it's already dry (none of my old dryers could ever do this; I had to spray water in my hair and re-dry).<br /><br />Another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle. This was not my experience. My dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle (look for a clear label that says DANGER). I highly recommend registering your product on the T3 website. I had problem with my full size dryer (not this travel size one), and the T3 Co, honored their warranty and fixed it.",4/2/2013

They will replace, but it costs money. For me it was $40 plus another $15 to ship. Absurd! They said even doing so was against their rules because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. Well, long story short, the manufacturer (T3) wanted $55 to replace. Amazon, knowing this is a poor business practice, stood behind their service and refunded the entire purchase price.

I had to go with a lower watt dryer otherwise I'd be flipping breakers every 5 minutes. It's very pretty. I dig the red.  It took a couple days to get used to holding it as it's a bit bulky. But to be fair my other one had a shorter nozzel and was lighter.  The placement of the setting switches is not optimal. I can't easily switch from low to high and back to low without looking at what I'm doing.  And the hot setting is not very hot. Which, I guess, my hair is thankful for.  But boy does she have great blowing power! It's like being in a wind tunnel. My hair dries in half the time now which is great!  I have used both attachments that came along with it too. I was afraid due to the force of the blowing it would blow those little gadgets right off and smack me upside the head but they stayed put.  The blow dryer is a little louder than I am used to but not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the product. I can overcome the negatives. Hope it lasts!<br /><br />_________________<br /><br />REVIEW EDITED SEPT 2013 =  And there she blows...out!  The heating element died already. I am very disappointed this hairdryer did not last as long as I expected it to. I understand....you get what you pay for....but it should have been longer than this. And I do not have long thick hair to where I am using and abusing the hairdryer. My hair is medium length and fine. It didn't have to work that hard!  I'm disappointed today and back on Amazon to shop for yet another hairdryer.",3/27/2013

Unfortunatley, since I had that thing for 7-8 years, they don't appear to make the EXACT same model, but this one comes pretty close.<br /><br />What I like:<br />- Comfortable to hold - the proportion and shape of the the handle are excellent<br />- Lightweight - so your arm won't get tired holding it<br />- 3 heat settings - and the &#34;very hot&#34; is actually hot enough<br />- Price - under $20!<br />- Color - my old one was grey, but this red is kinda sassy!<br /><br />What disappointed me:<br />- Speed - the highest speed is adequate, but it's not as fast as my old Vidal Sasson hair dryer (RIP, old friend)<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this to anyone who needs a basic hair dryer for not a lot of money, and if past experience can be repeated, this thing could last you a good half decade or more, depending on how often you knock yours off the bathroom counter.",3/26/2013

On the handle there is the option for warm and hot, and the one next to it has low and high.  There is a cool button on the back up by the mesh (when pressing this, it takes about 2 seconds for it to blow cool) - and on the side of the barrel there is the option for turbo on and turbo off - this gives 4 speeds of air flow.<br /><br />Just make sure the handle is all the way up, otherwise it will start to fold down on you.

The older one I was using was more than 20 years old and the difference is amazing. I have no idea if the tourmaline or any of the rest of it mean anything, but the difference between this dryer and my old one was great. My old dryer would almost burn my scalp and had only two settings high/hot and low/low. After drying my hair with this new dryer, my hair was silky and soft and, yes, no frizz. It also dried my hair very fast. I used the high speed with medium heat and it was perfect for the drying, then I turned it down to low heat and speed for styling.<br /><br />This dryer has separate buttons for heat and speed. I spent a lot of time staring at the picture that was on this page and could not tell if there were two buttons or just one, so I wanted to mention that, and I uploaded some pictures of the buttons as well. The buttons are next to each other on the handle, on the inside where your fingers grip. The sliding buttons are not easily moved, so it's not likely that you would slide them unintentionally while drying your hair.<br /><br />I ordered and received this blow dryer from Amazon.com, but the dryer they sent me was slightly different from the one pictured here. It looks almost exactly like this one, but the silver design on the side is smooth and it says you on it instead of infiniti and doesn't say Conair underneath, though it does say Conair on the nozzle part of the dryer. Other than that, the dryer they sent me is the same as this one: same specs, same buttons, same cord, so perhaps it's just a newer version of this dryer and the photo is outdated. The dryer I received also looks darker than the one in the picture, but it's a sparkly dark teal that looks very pretty.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it. Before purchasing, I saw the reviews of some that said it didn't last long, but I decided to order it anyway, since I didn't find another I liked better than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update. This blow dryer is still great. I love it. My hair has never looked better after blow dryer. I still have the same little quibble that I had before, though: the little tie that is attached to the cord is just much too short. It makes folding up the cord a pain. I have to put my glasses on and struggle with it for several minutes. I have a hand mixer with the exact same type of tie on it. It's just a little longer than this one and it's so easy to attach it. If they'd made this one even a half inch longer, it would have been so easy to use. I will probably try to find some alternative to keep the cord folded up, but they really should have just put one on that was long enough.<br /><br />Even so, the blow dryer is great. I love having different speeds and heat levels. Also, the hottest setting doesn't burn my scalp.etter than this one.

How one can last 3 years and the next only a year is beyond me.  I gave them a second chance....but no more.  One spark in the eye could ruin your vision for life.  Dangerous product to say the least.<br /><br />Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review.  It's worked flawless until today.  My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end.  This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review.  I'm buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it's been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can't beat it lasting 3 years.

So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up.

It doesn't seem too noisy when on and the volume of air it blows is pretty decent.<br /><br />The overall construction is as you would expect for the price...a glossy smooth plastic outer shell surrounding the internal heating/electrical/mechanical workings. The switch is easy to manipulate into the desired setting: down for low and up for high. The cool shot button allows the hairdryer to ramp up into the high mode but blow out cool air. The filter cover on the end of the hairdryer is easy to remove by twisting off. I prefer this type of filter cover over the hinged version that you cannot run under the sink for a good cleaning. If you ever rinse the filter cover, make sure it is absolutely dry before putting it back on the hairdryer as water and electricity do not mix! On the topic of electricity, the hairdryer also features a GFCI plug in case your bathroom doesn't have a GFCI outlet. This feature trips the power off to your hairdryer in case it comes into contact with water, preventing electrocution.<br /><br />The weight is decent and lightweight, not too heavy to hold while drying your hair. The handle could be a bit more comfortable, but for the money I cannot complain that much.<br /><br />I don't know about durability, but I think it was a decent purchase and very utilitarian.",1/26/2013

It is pretty quiet too. I wish the detachable nozzle went on easier & was a little longer. My only complaint is regarding the length of the nozzle. They call it the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment. When I am styling my bangs or blowing out my hair with a round brush - it makes the dryer too close to my head / hair and it makes styling more difficult.  My last hair dryer's attachment was longer with an air flow vent - to keep the air from blasting you in the head. I guess this will take some getting used to. Other than that - seems to be good quality. The plus is that it does dry my hair faster and with less noise.,1/23/2013

From reading the specs and reviews on this Andis 82005 dryer, I felt this one fit the bill. But after using it for a week, I have mixed feelings. Here is why:<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Sleek looking (so what? Nice, but doesn't make your hair look any nicer)<br />2. Nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely!<br />3. Long 10 ft. cord (if you need that, however I don't, and it really only gets in the way)<br />4. Hang loop<br />5. Dries hair fairly quickly (with Ion technology)<br />6. Outside stays cool to touch<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Heavier than the last two dryers we've had (Hot Tools Tourmaline Lite 1043 --- see my review on that one, and CHI low-EMF dryer).<br />2. Dries hair no faster than the two abovementioned ionic dryers<br />3. NOT quiet (in fact, louder than the two abovementioned dryers!)<br />4. Not enough speed/heat settings. Not much difference in heat settings, although speed settings are adequate.<br />5. Comb attachment actually hurts your scalp! Feels very scratchy, due to squared ends of the teeth.<br />6. Shiny silver-colored exterior shows prints, etc. much more than others.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad dryer... I guess I expected more. But I would probably go with another one next time.",1/15/2013

After trying unsuccessfully to get her to unplug it and put it away, I realized her life would be a whole lot easier if I just got her a wall mount hair dryer and deliberately mount it next to where she stands in front of the sink rather than mount it right next to the sink itself.  That solves a lot of problems: she doesn't have to use up drawer space for the dryer, I don't have to worry about her putting it away hot, it is always plugged in and ready, the coil cord never drags over the sink (so nothing getting knocked off the sink), and of course the risk of the dryer falling into the sink is practically eliminated.<br /><br />This hair dryer is conveniently small so it's easy to handle, even for a young teen with long hair.  It dries hair quickly because it is powerful despite its size.<br /><br />Wall mounting was trivially simple -- it took less than five minutes with my hand dandy drill/driver, bits, level, and a hand screwdriver (it is much better to use a manual screwdriver instead of a drill/driver to screw into wall anchors).

I mean huge.  Now maybe it's because this baby is an 1875 watt job and all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less.  When it is open, it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned.  When it is closed (folded, for &#34;travel&#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase) this thing is almost as big as my dopp (shaving bag).  Fortunately we travel more by ground so we don't worry much about suitcase space.<br /><br />And, as others have mentioned, the cord does not reel in all the way without help or retries.  We can live with that.  Even once the cord is stored, the cordstop leaves about a foot of cord out.  It wasn't a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too.<br /><br />On the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  FYI, all the girls in our family have long thick hair.<br /><br />A very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &#34;medium&#34; heat setting.  (Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  The reason &#34;medium&#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &#34;high&#34; can blow circuit breakers.  If you don't whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  (Ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife's hair is wet?)  The &#34;medium&#34; setting dries hair just fine.  The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I'm not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you're in a hurry.<br /><br />A word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  I don't know if it tells you that in the manual but it's always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  From staring at this unit, it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.",12/22/2012

As part of my transition to the civilian world, I have decided to grow out my hair because, in my mind, I believe I will one day look as stylish and sexy as Leonardo Decaprio.

It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military. To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.<br /><br />This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.<br /><br />For its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful.

This one has a powerful heating element (1875 watts), and a good fan (for its size). The purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water, but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air. The faster the stream and the warmer the air, the more evaporation occurs.  Where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide. This forces a much stronger blast of air (at least on high speed) that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle.<br /><br />If your hair is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly, you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature. That may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume.<br /><br />This dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly. You can adjust the fan speed and the temperature, but not the concentration of the air flow.<br /><br />So, if you have regular hair or (like me) are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly, this is the dryer for you. Put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast.",10/23/2012

I would definitely recommend this to others who want to be certain they have a functioning hair dryer while in European countries without having to purchase and take the risk of using a convertor.

It is almost impossible to buy 1600 W dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which I like.  The new 1875 W dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and I don't feel we need that much heat on our hair. We must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs, and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else.  Anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product.

Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!

I was fed up having cheap blow dryers that never lasted. I loved the blow dryer, it lasted me till a month ago. Guess the $110 I paid for it back then was worth the 6 years I got out of it. I was looking at buying the same one or at least a Chi blow dryer again, I just didn't want to spend the same amount of money, I was hoping to stay under $60. I did a bunch of research and saw that this blow dryer, T3 Featherweight, was on the list of best blow dryers the last few years and saw the price was close to what I wanted to pay and $30 cheaper than the Chi I had before. I also saw that it said it was a fast drying blow dryer like my old Chi, which I prefer since I have a ton of hair. After using it for over a week. I think it works pretty good.. not much difference from my Chi I had. It's lighter than my chi and it's made of some kind of plastic like material. It also looks solid white and black in the picture, but it's actually got some kind of silver pattern going on over the white which I'm not thrilled with, but it's not the reason I bought the blow dryer so I'll get over it. Seems to take about the same amount of time to blow dry my hair as the chi, maybe a little faster. I usually take about 8-15 minutes to blow dry my hair depending on how detailed i get with it, like I said I have a ton of hair.

I was a bit hesitant to get a fold-able travel dryer since their reviews don't tend to be as good, however this one was the exception, which is why I went for it.

I don't even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don't know why this is for Men. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews.

They sent the shipping box and the label as well and within 10 days I had a new dryer that I have been using since with no problems.  Granted it has only been a month but I was very impressed with Remington.  I just hope that no one there was injured when testing the dryer (lol)... it really did blow flames.  Obviously there was a short which could happen with any electrical product but it was the way that the company responded that I had to give the rating of 4 stars when previously I only give it 1.  I really do like this dryer and how my hair looks and feels afterwards which is very different from other dryers that are no ionic.  Plus it dries my hair super fast without drying it out.<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:  Bought this dryer 4 months ago even though I read the bad reviews as well as the good ones and was concerned but figured it was a good brand name. i only use a hair dryer at most 2x/wk. Last night I was using the dryer on my wet hair and flames and sparks started shooting out of it!!! Thank God my hair was wet and didn't have any flammable product in it. I showed it to my boyfriend who suggested that I contact consumer affairs for Remington, which I just did. Since it has been over 30 days I can no longer return the appliance to Amazon. I have had many hair dryers and most of the time they have just worn out after a year or 2 but this was just scary.<br /><br />1/18/13 - Almost 1 year later... and still working perfectly.  In fact, I bought another dryer in the interim, waiting for the new Remington and paid a pretty penny for the new one.  I used both multiple times, trading off one for the other.

Unfortunately, it looks like the quality of Conair's products has gone downhill since my previous purchase. This hair dryer has a Comfort Touch coating, which I initially thought was very nice. It feels soft to the touch rather than the slick plastic of the older models. But after just a couple of weeks of use, the coating started bubbling and peeling off in the area where I hold the hair dryer. I've only had it for a month and a half, and the outer coating looks positively pathetic already. I also don't like the settings on this model--there are only two speed settings, with the lower one being barely on. The high setting is okay, but it does make me feel like I'm in a wind tunnel at times.  This hair dryer has some pros: It gets quite hot, and it's fairly lightweight.

I was told that I would have to find a UPS drop-off point myself. (It was very frustrating dealing with the online chat rep.)  I tracked the return of the package to Amazon and waited for my refund. Six business days AFTER they received the hair dryer, I still didn't see a refund to my credit card.  This time I checked the box asking for one of Amazon's Customer Service reps to call me, which they did, immediately. This time, my experience with Customer Service rep #2 was excellent.

When I first started using T3's pro ionic/ceramic hair dryer last year,I noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair. After using it for about two months, I'm very happy with the results. My hair became more manageable and is less frizzy. It is soft and smooth. I thought all the Touramaline ionic/ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results. So I was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that I can have two ionic dryers on hand. I read the positive reviews on this Andis hair dryer, then I decided to purchase it. I'm thankful the delivery was super fast! After using it a few times, I have to say the result is just mediocre. Compare to T3, this Andis model loses its shine! My hair feels dry after using it. It doesn't seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the T3 does. It works just like a regular hair dryer for me, except because of the ionic in it, it does dry hair faster than non-ionic hair dryers. Overall, here are the pros & cons in my opinion on this Andis 75370 Tourmaline ionic/ceramic hair dryer.<br /><br />PROS: It has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior; a good size for home use; powerful air flow; dries hair fast; 3 heat settings/2 air speeds; has the cool shot button;<br /><br />CONS: feels heavy on hand & noisy; heat settings/air speeds settings are in odd position, the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer; the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright, it's very annoying; the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn't impressive; not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic?<br /><br />The Bottom line: This hair dryer is not bad, it does the drying job alright. I just don't think it's great for those with thick/wavy & coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry. If your hair type is normal & fine, frizz is not the major concern for you, you may be okay and satisfied with this one.w dry.

I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break so I can get by until a good one arrives. This is a good one, and what a difference! I'm so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would've been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a professional but I don't want charbroiled hair either. I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use. I'm fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren't bad at all; that's after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months.<br /><br />I ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.<br /><br />I even used the Elevate on my dog today without issue. Of course it helps that I used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/her.<br /><br />Addendum 03/15/2012<br />I've noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment.

The Tan Towels were just getting to be very pricey.  I found that these ones work just as well as the others! However, it seems like it takes a few more applications with the Loreal brand to get the same color as Tan Towels, but for this price that hardly matters.  Some may even think this is a positive, because it allows you more control over your tan.  I used these every night for 3 days and I have a wonderful natural looking glow.  Not too dark at all and not overly noticable.  These are great for us fair skinned folks that only need a bit of color.  I'm not sure you can call this a deep dark tan, but that wasn't what I was looking for anyway. These take a bit of practice to use (since you can't see where it is going on), but after becoming an expert with the Tan Towels, these were easy. Always use a circular motion! Also, I found that putting a little bit of lotion on my writs after application really helps with the steaking on my wrists (this was a problem area for me).

I'm no scent expert, but to me Fiori d'Arancio smells like *delicate fruit loops* Ok that sounds totally wacky but its a sweet, clean fruity smell, and smells natural--you can tell there arent chemicals in the scent unlike gross body splashes and stuff. its really hard to find a way to smell these before purchasing too, (occasionally you can find sample vials on an auction or deal site) and they are expensive, so the mini is a great way to test it out in an affordable way before upgrading to a full size. If the fruit loop smell is not for you, pass it on to a teenage girl you love. Personally I love it! Sometimes I mix it with my lavanilla rollerball for a delicious fruity vanilla scent!

I used the longest settings for the top (maybe 1.5), shorter settings for the side, and the shortest settings around the ears and back for a tight taper. It can cut very short and the cutting blades seem to be plenty sharp, giving a good cut. I do wish there would have been more guidance on How-To to give the user confidence in cutting their own hair.

I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold. I'm petite (small wrist) and I was afraid this would be a bit unwieldy, but it is lightweight enough to use without feeling at all flimpsy or cheap.<br /><br />The only fault I have found so far is the positioning of the buttons, right where my hand holds the dryer. For this reason I keep accidentally switching the air from hot to cold without wanting to. But it's a minor point given all the other advantages.eable and easy to hold.

I think super smoothing requires more proper technique than just a magic hair dryer.  Unfortunately I am not well versed in that technique, but with this dryer my hair doesn't look too frazzled and out of control.  My only issue with this dryer is that I have very long hair and sometimes when I am using it the hair gets sucked into the fan on the back end of the dryer.

It was made by Conair, was the same color, had the same attachments and had the same model number on the bottom of the box but it was called the Conair You Reel (see the picture I posted above). I called Conair to find out if they had changed the name and packaging of this hair dryer. I was told by the Conair Customer Service Department that You Reel is a subsidiary of Conair and although it is covered by the same warranty as the Infinti it is NOT the Infiniti. I called Amazon customer service and as always they were very friendly and offered to either send me another hair dryer or refund my money. Since I haven't even plugged the hair dyrer in yet I wanted to try it before deciding to return/refund it.

Even if the humidity is high, with this dryer my hair dries fast, frizz-free and straight.     It is heavy for my arthritic hands and arms, so I use a hair dryer stand, similar to [...], that I purchased many years ago at a drug store in their Made for TV section. I haven't timed it, but it seems to take less than five minutes to completely dry my hair.     The cord is approximately six feet long, long enough for my use since I don't walk around while drying my hair. The temperature and air control on the handle are slide levers. With arthritis, particularly bad in my thumbs, I find it somewhat difficult to adjust them, thus the four-star rating.     Color-wise, I'd describe it as a rich salmon. I don't see a purpose to the clear encasement over the dual fans, but that doesn't bother me one way or the other.

I also love that the dryer has a loop so that I could hang it on a hook (as my bathroom doesn't have much storage space).

The Remington didn't last me long (less than a year) and in general was a mediocre hair dryer but it got the job done.<br /><br />I'll start with the cons: I have thick long straight hair with a natural wave, my day to day hair style is scrunched. I have a universal diffuser that I love to use, it's huge and has high sides that are easy to scoop my long hair into. Unfortunately the first thing I noticed about the John Frieda Hair Dryer is the unusual shape of the nozzle. It is big and short and my universal diffuser does not fit it, nor will any universal diffuser on the market (at least I haven't found one yet). So I'm forced to use the attached diffuser that came with it. It does the job but it's not as easy to use as my old one. The buttons are also in a very awkward place, right where my thumb sits when I'm holding it so I'm constantly turning the temperature down by accident. I also end up hitting the cool shot button all the time. It takes some adjustment to get used to.<br /><br />Otherwise, this hair dryer is excellent, it's extremely powerful. It has cut my hair drying time down by half. Most of the time I don't even use it on full heat. If you don't use a diffuser or aren't married to using a larger universal one, I would definitely recommend this hair dryer. If it wasn't so awesome, I would probably return it for not fitting my diffuser but I think using the included one will be an okay compromise for me.",12/3/2011

The ones I received DO have the coiled cord, exactly like the picture (some say they received straight cords) and it turns off automatically when you return the dryer to the holder.

There are not many wall mount hair dryers to pick from, and I mostly liked this one while it worked.  BRIGHT night light (can be good or bad.. I liked it), nice physical design, and decent power.  I thought the air volume still did not compete with most $15 standard dryers, but if you are not looking for big air volume, it is fine. My wife misses a cold button.  So in all, a mediocre hair dryer but with great wall mount convenience and bright night light.  Now with the issues... Bought 18 months ago, worked fine except overheated very easily. If used on HIGH, it would run as long as you want till you shut it off, then the internal temperature would apparently overheat with no more airflow, and would refuse to turn back on for 5 minutes or so.  Annoying, but I got used to it by going to medium heat for about 10 seconds before shutting it off every time.  That seemed to cool it down just enough not to trigger the temperature limiter in case I needed to turn it back on right away.  I probably would have pitched it, but I liked the wall mount convenience and put 4 holes in my wall to mount it.  Well, here we are 18 months of life, and now it is completely dead. Night light on but the hair dryer is not home. I am electrically capable and could probably open up and fix this thing, but it is not worth the safety concern.  If you want to pay a premium for wall mount, just know you might only get a year or two out of it.. others seems to have similar experiences.  Sad that the $10 hand held models seem to last much longer.  Anyway, to cover up the holes in the walls, I am trying one of the other few wall mount options out there by another manufacturer. If this one dies, I am giving up on wall mount.  Good luck... hair dryers should not take this much thought.",7/18/2011

I've tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I'd give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.

I had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose.  Unfortunately, after about a year the blower switch broke right in half.  I bought this one to replace it.  I like that the dryer is reasonably priced so I didn't feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one.  This one has a couple of manufacturing changes, though, that I felt were downgrades. First and foremost, this one has a 6' cord, where the previous model had a 9' cord.  The cord doesn't swivel, so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement, whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap.  Second, Remington changed the direction of the blower switch, rather arbitrarily, so that up is now off instead of high.  I know this sounds petty, but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and I couldn't see a good reason to change it.  It probably won't be a problem for you if you didn't have the earlier model.    The drawback to the original, which is still a drawback on the current model, is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when I'm back-brushing I don't have good control over the hair.  On the earlier model I felt this was still workable and if you want lots of blow-power this model definitely fits the bill.    I ended up coming across a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic that I could try before buying, and even though it cost more I bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare.  It has the longer cord, heat and blower controls and while it has plenty of power it doesn't blow quite as hard on the low blower setting.  Since I was having to re-learn the controls on the T-Studio anyway, I figured I might as well get a longer cord out of the deal.",6/8/2011

I have thick, curly hair that I dry straight with a paddle brush.  My hair is definitely softer and smoother (I also use a leave in conditioner, glossing gel and heat protecting spray).  This dryer has cut the time it takes to dry my hair from 45 mins. to 25-30 mins. (depending on how damp my hair is when I start)  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because after the first two weeks of using the concentrator tool on a daily basis it no longer fits snug on the dryer.  It doesn't come off during use but it does rotate around and I am constantly repositioning it which is a bit annoying.  I've only had it for a few months so I can't comment on it's lifespan.

After researching many available on Amazon and other websites, I chose the Andis model because it offered the nighlight and a place for the cord. I've been using it now for two months.     Since it was going to take up a permanent spot in my outlet, it having a nightlight was dead useful.  I read other reviews saying that the nightlight was way too bright.  My husband and I disagree. We love the amount of light put out by the hairdryer.  It is signficantly brighter than our old nightlight which means you can get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and never have to turn on the overhead light.  Isn't that the point of a nightlight?  Maybe the people who dislike the amount of light have it in a master bath and don't close the door to the bathroom and it bothers them when they sleep? My solution would be to shut the bathroom door in that case!    Sorry that this turned into a review of the nightlight feature!  The hairdryer gives you as 1400 or 1600 watt option and I use it on the 1600 because I have massively thick hair.  It dries my hair quickly and is not obnoxiously loud.  I like that it has a cord keeper and keeps everything tidy in my teeny bathroom.  My husband had the hairdryer mounted on the wall in less than 10 minutes and that includes my running up and down the stairs for the right screwdriver.    All in all, an excellent buy and I would purchase it again.",4/15/2011

I invested a couple hours researching on line and reviewing the products here at Amazon. In the end, I selected the Conair Ion Shine because it was 1875 watts, was an ionizer, was priced affordably, and the design seemed good.<br /><br />Now that I have received the item and have had some time to use it, here are my ratings:<br />STORABILITY: 2.5 stars  There is a hanging loop, but  the cord is heavy and awkward. The unit is heavy enough that whatever hook one would hang it from would have to be substantially mounted so it would not pull out of the wall. (Wall mounting is not an option for me). Also, after only two uses, the cord has already begun to twist, which is a negative.<br />VALUE: 4.5 stars  I knew the Amazon price was reasonable, even lower than my local discount stores. After I purchased this item,  I found the same model at BIG LOTS for a dollar more and in different colors.<br />PERFORMANCE:  5 stars  Dries hair quickly without using high heat temps. Unit comes with a few attachments. The diffuser is really large and awkward to store. The unit has a hinged filter that opens easily for cleaning. The removable filter is the standard small piece of material that I have seen in other high-tech fan devices, including the high-end SmartTechnologies Smart Board in my classroom. I'm figuring the filter material is pretty standard. In my previous hair dryer, the fan did not have a removable filter for cleaning; eventually the old fan clogged so horribly (despite my attempts to brush it out)that it slowed down and eventually killed the unit.<br /><br />Other note: If a younger child will be using the unit, she may find the unit feels heavy or hard to hold after a while. I suggest looking for one of the smaller, portable units for tweens.",3/28/2011

It is dependable and delivers the temperatures I expect, but the main reason I chose this model is that the classic squirrel-cage blower produces great air flow. I was never satisfied with the wimpy blowers on most of the other styles.     I bought two of these from Amazon a few years ago. Two, because I thought such an inexpensive dryer might not last long very long and buying the pair was a better bargain because the order qualified for free shipping. The second one is still in the box awaiting its turn; the first one hasn't failed yet.    I see several comments here about travel. While this dryer is more compact than many of the bulky styling dryers, it is neither dual voltage (switchable) nor universal voltage (auto-converting), so pack a converter if you carry it overseas.

The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn't get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn't blow as hard as most other dryers.      For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I've got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn't benefit from a strong airflow.  Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don't have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  That doesn't happen with this Vidal Sassoon model.  The oval-shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow.      I also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently.  With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  So as a rule, I use the dryer with the ion setting in the off position except when drying the ends of my shoulder-length hair.  Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn't have this issue.         I've had this dryer for only about 5 weeks, so it's too early to comment on whether it's built to last - I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  This model might not be just right for every head of hair, but for mine, it's perfect.  I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time.",3/2/2011

The velocity alone is triple that of any I have ever seen and the fact that at this air output you can still melt plastic (within 1 inch).

Especially if you have a thicker hair structure (wavy, curly), or your hair falls naturally in a certain way but you want it to be styled in an opposite direction. Using more hair product helps a little, but a stronger air current will work better (even though it is more damaging for your hair & scalp, so USE CAREFULLY AND WISELY)<br /><br />I figured there are enough men out there looking for just this function, so I figured I'd help you all out.",2/9/2011

Awful button placement.,"**Review about BLACK CHROME version.**<br /><br />It's always a pain buying a new hair dryer--you're used to the one you had, annoyances and all, and it's a crap shoot as to whether or not you'll like the one you've bought sight unseen (although you've read the reviews and are hopeful).<br /><br />I wanted to love this hair dryer, but overall I just didn't.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that it is HEAVY. Well, not a bag of flour heavy, but it certainly has a definite heft to it (heavier than I was used to, at least) and for someone who needs to spend a good 30 constant minutes holding it and moving it around...it was heavier than I'd prefer.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed is that the cord is REALLY long. I never gave much thought to cord length, but it is advertised as 10 feet and I'm sure it is. I can't say as if I ever need a cord that long--in all my years using a hair dryer, I think a 3' cord would be plenty.<br /><br />The third thing I noticed was that the attachments are metal--which at first I thought was a bonus because it meant they would be sturdier. That said, since they are metal, they get HOT during use! Surprise, I know, right? Hee. But when you're used to plastic and suddenly have metal and you forget and grab the end...OUCH! Also, the attachments were a bit of a pain to put on. I had to fight with one of them because it didn't seem to want to click on easily (or at least as easily as any dryer I'd used before). I did finally get it on, and thought Well, at least it will STAY on. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with the resin pick attachment, which, in addition to being super awkward to use, came flying off the end in about seven seconds. The other concentrator attachments were fine, but that pick one was useless.<br /><br />The fourth thing I noticed is that the button placement SUCKS. I managed to turn it off at least 10 times in the first two minutes of using it. SOOOOO frustrating. Just grabbing the handle to hold it would bump it to OFF. GRRRRR. I tried to be especially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.<br /><br />The fifth and final thing I noticed is that the hot is REALLY SUPER HOT. I mean, so hot that you do have to really be careful how long you point it at your scalp--and I'd NEVER use it on my hair without putting some form of styling protectant on it first.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration, this was NOT the hair dryer for me. AT ALL. It was too heavy (minus one star), had hard-to-attach and useless attachments (minus one star), and had sucky button placement (minus one star). It's going back.ially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.

I have some hyperpigmentation from sun damage and monthly blemishes.  I have maybe had 2 facials in my life so my skin was not used to such a high concentration of salicylic acid, or any other kind of acid for that matter.  I have used the product about 4 times now.  The first time I used it I literally felt like the skin was burning off my face.  After the fourth use it's at the point where it still burns but it's not unbearable and I can last the whole 10 minutes.      Although the peel is painful it has definitely been worth it.  I was afraid I would have a lot of dry skin on my face which would show through my makeup since I have semi-dry skin already but it honestly wasn't that bad.  There were probably 3 small dry patches but you couldn't see them through my makeup and after the second day I used a dry washcloth and wiped the dry skin off.  My skin is very smooth now and the hyperpigmentation is almost gone.  Before I would never go out in public without makeup on because I felt like people could see my age in the condition of my skin but now I have no problem going out with a clean face.  I have used a number of products of all price ranges in the past to minimize the hyperpigmentation and nothing ever worked.  This is the first product I have ever used with success.      If you can't stand the pain and can only tolerate a minute or two the first couple times you use this product you will still see outstanding results.  Also, it says to use lotion after using the peel but I have been putting on toner and that has really been a more effective way of moisturizing my skin immediately after using the peel.    I gave this product 4 starts out of 5 due to the pain.  As far as effectiveness is concerned it deserves 5 stars but the stinging is really unpleasant.",12/4/2010

When it did work, it worked just okay. I didn't like the speeds on the fan or the heat settings. High is too high, low is too low, none of them felt quite right. Save yourself some money and buy the Remington D2012 that they sell here at Amazon. Our new one just arrived. It's got a quieter motor, absolute perfect fan speeds and heat settings, and a true 4 year warranty. Best part? You can buy almost THREE of them for the price I paid for the Bespoke.

I loved the Solano, but I wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well.  The good news is, it dries just fine.  The bad news is that the concentrator attachment (there are three attachments - I use the narrow concentrator every day for straightening) is unnecessarily difficult to attach.  For the first couple of months, it took a great deal of effort and force to get the concentrator nozzle attached.  I had to twist and turn and manuever it every which way.  Even when I managed to get it on, it was easy to knock it off during the course of drying my hair.  I had to wait a minute or two to reattach it because the nozzle was too hot to handle.  When it cooled down sufficiently, the twisting and turning began anew.  When this happened numerous times during one attempt to dry my hair, it got pretty frustrating.<br />As others have noted, the thin chrome finish of the dryer chips off very easily, particularly when using the attachments.  After having owned this for about two months, the chrome is completely chipped off (the dryer has a matte black finish underneath the chrome) where the concentrator attaches.  It doesn't look great, but I don't have to worry anymore about brushing chrome flakes off my clothes every morning.<br />Over the past week, it's gotten much easier to get the concentrator attached, and it's less prone to fall off.  I assume it just took a couple of months to stretch.<br /><br />Update 11/9/10: The attachment no longer will stay on the dryer.  I'm reducing the rating to two stars, because without the attachment, this dryer is worthless to me.",8/19/2010

It is nice that the GFI is built into the unit and not on the plug so that the plug does not block an outlet or have to plug into the bottom outlet only. I recommend this product.

My hair is shoulder length, somewhere between curly and wavy, tends to be dry and frizzes very easily.  I am typically a slave to the flat iron, but no more.  Here is what I did, step by step to achieve my best hair day ever (that I have done myself- no salon styling included).    1). I washed and conditioned my hair, as usual  2). After towel drying my hair, I used a wide tooth comb to smooth it out and put a dollop of leave in conditioner on the ends.  I then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while I putzed around the house.  3). I sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair I was not blow drying at the time.    4). On each section I was drying I put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair.  5). Using a 1.25 round natural bristle brush, I blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer.  As I was done with each section, I clipped it away and worked with one section at a time.  It got a little awkward in the back, but I figured I would touch up with the flat iron at the end.  6). There was no need for touching up!  My hair came out great.  I used a dollop of shine wax when I was done drying and shaped my hair.  I finished with a spritz of hair spray.      Even if this hair dryer broke after one use, I would shell out the cash to get another one.  It is that worth it.  I did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and I did not think it was too heavy to work with either.  What can I say?

I get so tired of trying out skincare products made for combination skin (normal/oily). Face creams for dry skin is just too much moisture and oil for my type of skin. Finding good all natural skincare is even harder. I use Pangea Organics line for the day time. I use this oil for night because I wake up with very oily and very dry skin. Using this actually helps reduce this and makes my skin feel so much softer. It's hard for me blend this oil on my face alone without using more than 2 drops. So, I mix this in with my Pangea Organics face lotion at night and wake up with refreshed-looking skin. I haven't tried using this oil in the day time since I get the midday oil slick, but I hear Argan Oil reduces the oiliness without drying the skin. Here's another bonus, my skin tend to get flushed in the afternoon, like as if I just ran a marathon. Using this Argan Oil reduced the redness.     One of the reviewer says it might not be pure because it is fragrance free, instead will try one that has the fragrance. I don't doubt this is product is of lesser quality because the information supplied by Slice of Nature says that there are 3 processing types for Argan oil. One of them is make Argan oil fragrance free and most of the time comes out clear. The other type of processing keeps the fragrance and the color is yellow or darker AND it is mostly used for cooking, maybe for cosmetics. I personally don't want to put cooking oil on my skin, since cooking oil can go rancid very quickly. That's like saying that I will put grapeseed cooking oil for my body. Would you do this? This one from Watt's Beauty is clear and it is contained in a very simple and plain brown bottle with a dropper, which is very useful.     As always with any consumer products, it's always either you like it or you don't. I personally like this and will continue to use it.    I haven't tried using this on my hair or on my body. My hair is pretty normal. I do intend on using this with my body lotion very soon.",8/5/2010

I had tried my razor with the factory Merkur blade, and I got a half-decent shave, but I had to be very careful because the blade would randomly dig into my skin. I switched to Derby, and what a difference a Derby makes.<br /><br />The blades are very sharp- my wife tested them gently dry-shaving a bit of leg hair, and they left an instant bald spot. However, they're not too sharp as some people have said a Feather blade can be- I can even press down on my razor just a bit in trouble areas to get really close results, and not have to worry too much about slicing myself open.<br /><br />If you're just starting out with double edge shaving, do yourself a favor and pick up some Derby blades. The only reason I'll consider switching potentially to find a razor with more economical packaging. Derby blades come in little plastic mini-tubs that are individually wrapped, not to mention the blades are also individually wrapped. I would prefer to be a touch more environmentally conscious and get a paper sleeve full of razors instead of six plastic boxes.<br /><br />When packaging is your biggest concern about a product, you know there's good product in there.

I personally think it does a better job on the genital area than on the bikini area.  It really makes a difference at what angles your hair grows, and if your hair is on the smoother side and grows very parallel to your skin (like it does on the areas that would show right around my bikini line), it's tough to get it all with this shaver.  It does a good job on the more coarse hair in more intimate areas, as those stand at more of a perpendicular angle (especially when they're short and stubbly after having been shaved a few days before).    You will have to pull gently at your skin and/or hold it in a kind of pinched way sometimes to make sure you get all of the hairs at an angle the shaver will reach, but none of that is painful and it does work.  You'll also have to go over each area more than once, so plan on devoting a few minutes to the process (more than that for your first time or two), because you won't be able to get it all super quickly with the multiple runs over areas and the need to stretch and pull your skin.  I haven't really had any experiences of it pinching or nicking my skin.  Do use some sort of baby powder, particularly in damper areas to make the skin dry and easy to run the shaver over.    I use a compressed air can, along with the little cleaning brush that comes with it, to clean it after each use.  I don't think the brush does a thorough job on its own.    Overall I'm quite happy with this product and would recommend it as a worthwhile purchase.  I have to use it pretty much every day to stay truly smooth, and there are a couple tiny areas that I tend to run a razor over (going in the same direction as the hair so it won't create razor burn) after using the shaver just because the hair in those places isn't at enough of an angle for the shaver to really reach.  You would definitely need to use a trimmer to get the hair to a short stubble before using this shaver; I opted for actually shaving everything with a razor first, and then using the shaver to shave the stubble once it started growing back a day or two later, and have continued doing that stubble maintenance ever since.    The battery life is also pretty good.  I've had the razor for about six months now and have changed the batteries only once so far, probably a couple of months in, while using it every few days.",8/5/2010

She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself. I would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode.",8/5/2010

This was my third purchase; I take the recommended six tablets per day; I'm in my fourth month of using this supplement and I plan to continue with it, indefinitely. Initially, there was a substantial weight loss - a little too much for me - but I've since regained what I needed. My fine hair seems no thicker - but - where there was a noticeable receding hairline, all the hair has regrown and that sure is wonderful. Complexion and fingernails show nice improvements, but the most remarkable for me is that I no longer need to wear supports for my ankles when I'm active. I suffered a degree of permanent damage to the tendons in both ankles many years ago, to the point that I had to be careful just getting out of bed in the morning. Now, I am pain free and enjoy wearing the shoes of my choice.

A MUST HAVE!,"I have WHITE blonde eyelashes and eyebrows. I never leave home without mascara (yeah, okay, and a little lipgloss, too. I'm vain). I found so much FREEDOM in using this product!  I can now go to the water park, the pool, the beach, etc and actually have noticeable eyes without having to bother with waterproof mascara (that destroys your lashes anyway).    It was easy & fast to use -- start to finish, including clean up, it took maybe 10 minutes. If it's messy for you, you're using too much of the gel at one time. The trick is to make sure you use the 1st chemical several times and allow it to soak through the hair's cuticle. Once that's done, it's just a matter of barely touching your lashes with the colorant gel and presto! Dark lashes!      Ladies, it only COLORS your existing lashes, it doesn't make them longer or thicker.  If you take your time and apply it carefully, you can get it to go from the base to the tips of your lashes.

I am Asian, with a medium-light complexion that is already fairly wrinkle and acne-free; but I was starting to see more melanin spots on my face developing, as I didn't start using sunscreen on my face daily until age 30 (I am now 35). However, my skin does tend to be oily in the T-zone, and I would still get an occasional pimple on my forehead or under my cheekbones on a regular basis.     After using this product, I noticed that my already scarce breakouts became practically non-existent, and though some of the small freckles on my upper cheeks haven't faded much, my skin does feel and look smoother and clearer. I don't use concealer, powder, or foundation (I can't stand the look and feel of it on my skin), and only use Shiseido SPF 55 for the face on a daily basis, but this seems to be all I need to still look pretty flawless, which I attribute to some of the peel's effects. I originally only used the 35% glycolic acid peel sold by the same company, but decided to try this lactic acid/glycolic acid combination to see if it would have a different or stronger effect (it does sting/tingle more than the 35% glycolic acid peel alone). I usually use this product every 7 days, and leave the solution on for a full 10 minutes (it stings and tingles, but this doesn't bother me much; leaving it on this long doesn't cause any hot spots on my skin, either, but my skin is pretty resistant to a lot of environmental insults). I also notice that small blackheads and sebaceous plugs in my forehead and nose will loosen easily and can be pushed or exfoliated out more easily after using this peel.     Overall, I think this is a good maintenance peel for those who want to slow (or possibly even reverse) the subtle signs of aging, i.e. development of melanin pigmentation from sun exposure, smoothing the surface of the epidermis, possibly neutralizing fine lines, and decreasing acne. I will likely continue using this product, until I become adventurous enough to perhaps try something different and stronger (i.e. a 70% Lactic Acid peel). The price is right, too, and won't cost you the overhead you might pay for having the same type of peel done at a medi-spa.",8/5/2010

It feels like you just had your teeth cleaned every time you brush!  Up until amazon started carrying the product you had no option but to buy it at the dentist office with their marked up price.  Now, with the price cut in half, I could afford 2 of these for everyone in the house.<br /><br />The sterilization chamber holds 2 brusheads of either size and angles them towards a sanitation UV lamp (254 nm) - the cycle runs 15 minutes which is sufficient to kill anything on the bristles after use.  I've had my brushes over a year now and still am using the origianl lamp.  You get two indications that it is working, a flashing led above which goes steady once the process is finished and the chamber has not been opened (then it goes out) - plus the philips logo lights up from the UV inside but blocks the harmful rays from escaping by flourescing in the UV glow of the lamp.<br /><br />This is a good system for children, as it has reminder buzzes on when to move on to the next set of teeth, and has 5 different cycles from gentile to vigorous.  My dentist recommended it to me, and I recommend it to anyone who doesnt't want to see their dentist as often!<br /><br />Positives:  It charges using an induction charger - meaning there are no exposed wires.  A coil hides behind the charging station and a second coil is inside the toothbrush.  When they are in close proximity (2) they couple energy from the AC line to the brush under charge.  This is a safe method of charging and does not require cords to plug into the brush.<br /><br />Negatives:  The system has one li-ion battery.  Once it expires, philips provides a mechanism to use a screwdriver to remove the battery before throwing away the toothbrush, thus guaranteeing you will buy another one.  It would have been as easy to put a cap on the bottom allowing you to replace the expired battery at that time and then continue to use the brush electronics, which are very robust.<br /><br />Of all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.

Soft heat and light weight!,"Purchased this item because I'm needing to transition from no-lye relaxed 4b or 4c hair to natural hair. As stated, by many hair professionals of African American hair studies, that grade 4b or 4c hair is prone to dryness and needs plenty of moisture. So, I was looking to wash my hair then press it, but my hair takes hours to air dry; though, it appears dried once I towel dry it... it still retains water. Dampness effects my press iron, if my shafts are not free from vapor; therally. Well, I will be using and have used this dryer to quick dry my hair and afterwards press it. Both heat tools that I have now are of tourmaline and ceramic technology...I believe this system is better because they will ensure least harsh heat on my hair shafts. Glad that it adds shine to my hair and I look forward to continuous usage in the future.

And, despite the technology it doesn't appear to dry my hair any faster than the old dryer I replaced.

The features I like about the Andis hair dryers I've used were that they were not too large or heavy, they had medium heat to medium-high heat, they didn't blow too hard, and they were relatively quite.  I've used some hair dryers that almost gave me wrist strain trying to hold them, and some that caused your ears to ring once your hair was dry.  The Andis' hangup models seem to find a good compromise between function and low noise levels. I've put these in all our bathrooms at home, since they can be used without disturbing others in the house even if they are sleeping.  Some different models of Andis dryers I've owned before would stop working after about a year due to a diode on the on/off switch overheating and failing, but this model doesn't seem to have that issue.  Other nice features that this 30975/HD-10L has are that there is no GFI transformer plug at the end of the cord...It's built into the base housing of the dryer.  Also, this unit comes with a cord hang-up bracket which can be placed on either side of the base. Like other hair dryers the on/off switch will reset to the off position when it's placed back into the base wall holder. Taking the dryer out of the base again will resume the flow of warm air. Some reviewers have complained of the brightness of the built-in nightlight. It's not annoying to me and it can be use it as the only nightlight in the bathroom. If I could ask for only one additional feature, it would be a way to change the color of the LED light.  There are many LED nightlights on the market that let you select what color you'd like the light to have, and lock it to that color.  This would be a nice feature to have on this unit, and might please those that think the light is too bright.  Last, this unit has a metal wall bracket and paper template, so it's actually very easy to install. The plastic base then screws to the metal plate, once mounted, with two small screws hidden by the hair dryer when it's in the base. Any excess cord can be hidden inside the base, so between not having an unsightly GFI box on the plug end and the fact that you can shorten the cord to just a few inches, if needed, makes for a very clean installation. No cords unsightly tangled cords hanging around your bath to get caught on other stuff.  And not having the GFI plug allows other appliances like cordless tooth brushes, shavers, or rollers to be used on the same wall outlet without the adjacent plug(s) being blocked.ted, with two small screws hidden by the hair dryer when it's in the base.

When I got home, I found this one on Amazon and ordered it. I love this hair dryer! I use it all the time - not just when traveling. It's light-weight so my arms don't get tired, and it blow dries my short haircut very quickly - about 5 mins with styling. I also like that it doesn't have that long blower on it which is harder for me to use for some reason. I saw the review about it not working right in Spain, but I was very pleased with how it worked in Greece. There is a screwlike switch you have to turn for European voltage and I wonder if the previous reviewer did not realize this? When the hair dryer is set to European voltage, there is only one speed (high), instead of the usual high and low, and I was pleasantly surprised that the hair dryer worked perfectly in Greece, just as it did at home - same strength and heat. The only maintenance was to clean the filter with an old toothbrush once in awhile as it would get covered with lint from hair products I use and then the dryer would overheat - but this is something I have to do with any hairdryer I purchase. After being used everyday for about three years, it's starting to sound as if the motor is going and so I'm back to buy another one. My daughter tried mine and liked it so much, she got one also.

The buttons on the dryer are in an awkward place and I'm forever accidentally bumping them and switching the settings or accidentally turning it off, mid-dry.  I did not notice any difference in my hair using this dryer with its purported ion technology.  The thing that annoys me the most about this dryer is the cord.  It's nowhere near long enough for my liking.  It's so short that I barely have enough length to dry my hair without sitting down - and I'm 5'3!

If you don't apply the product several times in heavy coats you don't taste anything and it needs to be reapplied frequently (at least daily).  Also, while using the product it seemed that the taste would happen several seconds after going to bite my nails which made it rather ineffective as a control mechanism.  And when eating or drinking anything if you just so happen to touch or lick anywhere near your nail it gives your food what seems to be a more bitter and effective bad taste compared to your nails themselves.

The dryer is much much lighter than what I'm used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn't feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5 below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn't stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.

Shipping was fast, the product came in a plain box and was well packaged.  I have several skin tags on my neck and applied product carefully with a q-tip as directed. It has a stinging sensation on application so I was careful not to apply too much solution to the tags. I got some of the solution on the surrounding skin but applied the ointment to stop the burn. The solution burns the skin very quickly so you have to be carefuly not to apply too much. The burns has caused my skin to become discolored, my neck now looks worse than before and my tags haven't fallen off yet. That was a week ago, so I will now use a small brush to apply and hopefully this will prove a better applicator than the q-tip. I am now looking forward to be rid of the tags and acid burns on my neck.    If you are interested in purchasing this product, please proceed with caution. Maybe the suppliers could provide a small applicator with this purchase.",3/11/2010

I have the Advance handle and Philips no longer makes replacement heads for the Advance handles but instead has a slightly different head called e-series that is supposed to fit the Advance handle.  I ordered the three pack of the e-series and it does fit the original Advance handle but be advised that he makes a louder noise when in use.  Apparently, the magnets on the e-series' don't match what was originally designed for the Advance handles.  I called Philips and demonstrated the noise difference over the phone to the technician and even she could tell the significant difference in noise.  It's not unbareable by any stretch but is not as comfortable as using the old replacement heads.  The technician did not know about the difference in noise, checked with others and then got back to me that, yes, there is a difference in noise.  Philips should tell the user about this difference.  It's no big deal, but should be disclosed.<br /><br />What I found interesting also is that the new package says to replace the heads every 3 months.  The old packaging said every 6 months.  When I asked the technician about this and asked if this meant that the new heads were not made as well as the old heads and was this part of the American corporate conspiracy to have consumers buy more and spend more, she said they changed the recommendation on the advice of dental professionals.  Whether these dental professionals are part of the conspiracy, I do not know.  Whether the new heads are not as well built as the old, I also don't know.  But in any event, since I've been using the Sonicare for the past 15 years or so I've changed heads every six months or so and my teeth have not fallen out and I've had no complaints from my dentist.  I guess I'll update this review four months from now and advise whether my teeth have fallen out and are full of cavities all because I didn't change the replacement head after three months.<br /><br />But to Philips credit, at least they didn't simply stop making a head to fit the Advance handle and thereby force the consumer to buy a new handle for the new heads.

In all honesty, I never use the hanger. I leave my cord dangle. It actually helps to detract from the power cord that runs to the outlet. If I hang the cord, I actually feel like that just spreads out the cord mess. That may be something to consider if you are buying this model for the cord hanger.    The nighlight is not as bright as some of these reviews would have you believe. If you go from having a completely dark bathroom to having this light, you will notice the room is much brighter at night, but the light is no brighter than any other night light.    You will need the right size allen wrench to switch the dryer from 1200W to 1600W as this does not come with the dryer.     I had no problems with the screw length for mounting as others have stated, so they may have fixed that problem.    This dryer is much quiter than my previous dryer which was an 1875W regular handheld model. It's not silent, but it is quieter than any dryer I've owned.    Even though this and other wall mounted dryers have lower wattage, I don't notice a significate increase in drying time (maybe a minute or two). I actually prefer the lower wattage now because I'm not blasting my hair (or scalp!) with heat which tended to cause split ends and fry my hair after continued use (I don't curl or use a flat iron, so the difference is purely a result of the hair dryers). Also, once I finish blow drying, my hair looks like it will for the rest of the day (an moderate amount of volume), whereas with the 1875W dryer, my hair would be a pouf ball first thing in the morning and gradually flatten to my head by the end of the day.     Other notes: The dryer itself is a medium size. I like that it's not one of the tiny ones because I feel like it's not flimsy and weak (even if smaller ones really aren't). It's also not as big and heavy as full sized dryers, so I find that I move it around much more and get more even drying.",3/9/2010

Didn't need the nightlight, but after a couple of nights, the soft green glow came in handy when waking up in the middle of the night due to cats or a need to use the toilet.  Even the hubby who is sensitive to light at night was comfortable with it as long as it wasn't facing the bed.    The loop on the back is flat and not a circle so you have to hook the cord over it just like in the picture.  I had expected it to be a full circle sticking out from the wall, but it sits flush.  Still, the cord does stay in place so I can't complain.  I have a good hair dryer and it's finally off the counter!",1/30/2010

Convenient to use.,"Okay, how could I have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall?  It's a no brainer!  Dragging out the hairdryer every day and trying to put it away neatly is a hassle and there is no reason to put up with it any longer!  I bought 2 Oster 76932-710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath.  Now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice hotel upgrade.  Everybody comments on what a good idea.    The 710 watt Oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair.  The dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder.  It took me about 30 minutes to install both dryers...and that included the time it took me to find my drill and try and read 3/16 on the drill bit!  Buy this...it will only make you happy!",1/30/2010

I've had this one a little over a month and it is so much better.  Easy to mount.  Easy to use.  I love that it turns off when you set it back in the cradle.

I recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE12/2012:  Around the beginning of 2012 the unit's high setting stopped working.  Or rather it works intermittently.  Sometimes it will come on but most times it does not.  This makes it hard to dry thick or long hair.

I have to completely and forcefully dry it in order to tame it down.  I've bought dozens of blow dryers in my lifetime to battle my hair, most from the drugstore.  Despite having consistently mediocre-to-poor experiences with these cheapies, I stupidly found myself continuing to buy them.  I have no fewer than 4 unused Conairs relegated to the hall closet because they don't perform acceptably.  And that's in addition to the countless ones that I've thrown away when they broke.      So I finally decided to change tactics and buy a higher end model.  My hair stylist recommended the Elchim brand, as that's what they use in the salon I go to (Vidal Sassoon salon).  It's definitely a step up from the Conair, but there are some things I don't love about it.    Things I Like:  -Good, strong air flow  -Feels Solid - plastic feels strong and not flimsy.  I've only had it for a few weeks, so it remains to be seen how durable it is compared to the drugstore cheapies, but it feels like it won't break as quickly.  -Long cord so you can move around as needed  -3 settings each for air flow and heat    Things I Don't Like:  -Hottest setting is extremely hot.  I burned my finger by touching MY HAIR after drying a lock on the hottest setting!  Unfortunately, the medium setting isn't quite hot enough.  So I've been using the hottest setting and moving it around fast so it doesn't heat up one area long enough to fry my hair or my fingers.  It's tiring and I'm hoping it doesn't damage my hair long term.  -No cool shot.

It's been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It's fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm. The other day (now about 6 months ago) however, the button to retract the cord flew off (with spring) while the cord was furiously being pulled out. I tried to reattach but it lost its retracting mechanism. Fine, now it's a regular drier. Although I do have to admit it's definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually.

The bristles just squish out and do not stay stiff enough to work hair. I think the boars bristles would be even worse with thick hair. They need a stiff nylon brush option.  They also need a medium speed for drying. You get slow low and fast high and if you can hold your finger on the quick heat button then maybe you can get to medium heat and blowing speed from the low setting but you can't hold the button for long. There should be some sort of trigger with the quick heat button built in or a way to lock it down. I don't use the other two attachments.

I have straight hair as is.  But coworkers and friends have been commenting a lot lately on how healthy my hair has been looking since I starting using it.<br /><br />I guess the other comments on Amazon not being an authorized dealer and therefore voiding the warranty can be a deterrant, but being able to save $100 compared to retail was significant enough for me to take a chance on that.",11/16/2008

It reminds me of the way hair dryers used to be designed: moderate heat but high air flow. That's the correct way to do it. (The cheap mass-market hair dryers started getting this backwards around the time they all transitioned from squirrel-cage fans to radial fans. Heating-element wire is cheaper than decent fans motors, I guess; and if that turns a hair dryer into a blowtorch, so what -- people who don't know any better will buy them anyway.)    This particular unit has a very long round cord. I can't vouch for the cord's durability, but I see no reason it wouldn't hold up. Even if it were fragile, though, I'd still want to own this hair dryer. Cords are easy to replace. I've put two on my massive GE steam iron, an old-timer from the 1960s.    In summary, then, this dryer is tough, heavy, quiet, comfortable, extraordinarily effective, and obviously built for the long haul.

From the very first day she used this thing, she started getting compliments about her hair. Her hair is normally pretty straight and flat, and it definitely had more body.  It was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever that's worth. The compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the new look, but my wife is still raving about it.<br /><br />I purchased this for her because I got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years. The latest one I put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online. She and I needed a change. I read all of the good reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />The Elchim is everything I hoped for in a hairdryer. The first thing my wife and I both noticed was that it was MUCH quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used. Its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers' lowest setting.  We can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair. I figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing, but I was very concerned when she dried my daughter's hair.  It definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerful.<br /><br />Secondly, the quieter airflow was very powerful. 1500 liters/minute is the claim. I haven't ever seen another volume measurement, but it sounds impressive, right? Anyway, as others have stated, my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally. She thought I was nuts when I showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet, but she was pleasantly surprised. It has a removable filter screen (twist-off) on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time. The buildup of hairspray, makeup, lint, and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it. This congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the past.<br /><br />Elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavy-duty use. It has a thick round cord, which will be much less prone to tangling. It is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned.  It has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor. This will prove great for packing. I expect it to last for years.<br /><br />I read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers, Tourmaline, ceramic heating elements, EMF, etc., but none swayed me away from common sense. See below:<br /><br />The ionic dryers are supposed to trap moisture in your hair. A few things on that: Moisture = weight. Weight = flat. Conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down. Many use wax, which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair down.<br /><br />There are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes. Science note: Breaking down a molecule of water (H2O) leaves hydrogen peroxide (HO) and a free hydrogen atom (H). We now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes, right? Ionic dryers don't heat the air, they heat the hair from within. Isn't that what microwaves do? There are good Ionic dryers out there, but be wary of the claims. Some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches. I did not see a need to risk anything like that.<br /><br />Last thing about ionic dryers, the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last. A good ionic dryer will cost you more than the $29.95 delivered! versions. Read the reviews, none of the 5-star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use. Many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency, lack of performance, and breaking down altogether. If you want a good ionic dryer, be prepared to spend a little. If the cheapies were the answer, they would be in use in the salons.<br /><br />Bottom line: Your hearing matters; protect it.  Proven technology matters; ignore the hype about trapping moisture in the hair you are trying to dry. Ergonomics matter; pack-ability, weight, and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer. My wife's arrived in all black...so what. She never paraded one around in the past, and I don't expect her to anytime soon. They only make black, white, red, and red-black, no neon or orange surprises. There is no substitute for quality and durability. While you may not always get what you pay for, if you buy cheap things, the adage holds true.<br /><br />I researched these things thoroughly before I bought it and read several reviews where people were using their Elchim hair dryers for 10+ years. I have no doubt that this will follow those lines. Salons around the world use them several hours per day. Ours should last for years. Well worth the $60-ish I paid.<br /><br />*** Update - Feb 20, 2010 ***<br /><br />After about two years and NO abuse, the cord on my wife's hairdryer crapped the bed. What is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle. I expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped. It broke where it should have never been an issue. I cut the cord about two inches from the solder points, where I thought the break would be, intending to solder back on. As it turned out, the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut. When I dissected the failed portion, it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process. I still hold that the hairdryer is top-notch. I will repair the cord on the next one I get, if I get the same model. Why do I need another one? Read on.<br /><br />For the guys out there saying no biggy, I can fix a cord, beware. For the record, this thing is a BEAST to disassemble and reassemble. Iwork with all sorts of electronics. When it originally failed, I opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal. Once I was inside, I saw the problem was not there. However, there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair. After reassembling the hairdryer, I could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter. I threw it out after MUCH frustration and solder. It did work when I got it back together, but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concern.<br /><br />I regret doing this because I was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break. Alas, I was wrong. I think I will look for a newer/different model by the same manufacturer. I DID NOT contact Elchim to see how much a repair was. After shipping both ways, I'm sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself. I did email them a detailed description of the failure though. Nobody has replied to that letter. My wife hates the replacement dryer(tourmaline) and wants her Elchim back.<br /><br />For all those that I doubted: I'm stupid. You're smart. I was wrong. You were right. You're the best. I'm the worst. You're very good looking. I'm not attractive. (from Happy Gilmore) I thought about posting pictures of my failure, but what's the point. I edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke. Good electrician, possibly a good deal. I would change my star rating, but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot. If you read this far, you must have felt it was helpful too....or at least amusing?<br /><br />*** Update - December 2013 ***<br /><br />When the last one died (my fault) three years back, I didn't replace it because she had purchased a cheap stand-in while I wrongfully attempted to fix the cord. She simply kept using it after I killed the Elchim. I put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than I should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die. Well, it lives on, but my patience broke. I reluctantly coughed up the money for a new Elchim. Same model, just different color. OMG, it's so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning. We can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair. She'll probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again. I felt a bit stupid after I killed the first one, and I didn't want to augment that feeling by spending $$$ for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement. Now that I swallowed my pride and replaced the Elchim, everyone's happier...and I'm sure we hear a little better too.",3/27/2008

I purchased it because I was excited about the good reviews. It does a pretty-good job, but the problem is that the 'blow' action of it is really weak. To use it I have to use the funneling head attachment, but there is almost no airflow on the low setting. Because there isn't a very high volume of air running through the dryer, the air is also a bit hotter than I'd really like it to be and I worry about damaging my hair... I find that I need to cut my hair more frequently since I've purchased this blow drier. I'm going to shop around in the near future for a better dryer.

This dryer produces an impressive jet stream of air, with a selection of 3 heat settings.  The technical specifications boast Clouds of negatively-charged ions neutralize positive charges that are in the air and reduce the static electricity that causes fly-away frizzies and dulls hair.  Well, I don't know what all of that means but I will admit that my hair is not frizzy after using this dryer.  There is also a cold-shot button, which quickly removes heat from the air output, which is a great feature.  The dryer has a little weight to it, but it is not bulky and seems to be balanced quite well.  All hair dryers are fairly noisey but this Conair 209R Ion Shine is quieter than most of my previous dryers.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this model, the built-in cord retractor, seems to be getting negative comments from other reviewers here on Amazon.  Common sense tells me that I should hold onto the heavy power adapter with one hand while holding in the cord release buttong with the other.  You easily control the retraction speed this way, which prevents the end from whipping around as most people are complaining about.  It's really not a big deal and doesn't take much effort on the user's part.<br /><br />I do wish that this dryer had three air speed settings, since high is sometimes too harsh, and the low setting is usually too soft.

This is the smallest unit of its kind I've seen.  The mounting bracket is barely wider than the dryer, which makes putting it into tight places a snap.    The relatively minor disadvantages have to do with the installation.  First, the power cord length cannot be adjusted.  It is one continuous cord from the bottom of handset, through the mounting bracket, and down to the GFCI power plug.  Some competing dryers have an electrical junction in the bracket which allows you to shorten the wire running from the bracket to the wall outlet and makes for a neater, tangle-free installation.  Second, and this is a quibble, the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy.  I substituted a better pair I had sitting around in my toolbox.

This dryer is like a miracle!  Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  I'm telling you, if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone.  I've tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  In just about every way this dryer makes you think it's not up to the task but if you give it a chance you'll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    For instance, this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air.  People tend to think it doesn't have enough power but that's not because it isn't working, it's because it doesn't need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn't poof up your hair.  If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  It's quieter, lighter and doesn't require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  I'll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven't estimated by how much.  It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing smoke rising from my hair when I used it.  This alarmed me because I thought I was damaging my hair.  Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  It has no smell and it seems like water vapor.  I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I've been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  I sometimes feel like I've used a relaxer on my hair!    The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  There are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls.    Other than that, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  I often see women with thick curly hair act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone.  Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it's because the person hasn't learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  Now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too!  ;-)    UPDATE May, 2008:  I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it's still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever and I am still thrilled with its performance!",6/15/2007

It has two settings: Low and High.  I use High almost exclusively, even though I have fine, short, grey hair because I don't like to dawdle over grooming in the morning.  Its dual voltage selections (125V/250V) would come in handy if travelling (with an added plug adapter).  High produces a rapid stream of air that quickly heats up and stays at a steady, moderately high temperature.  Low is appropriate if you spend more time styling with some degree of heat--producing a nice smooth and fuller result.  However, I'm a Type-A character who wants the job done pronto, so this is my machine of choice.  All dryers sound a little loud right in your own ear, but a family member says that the Andis is quieter than the Sunbeam I recently replaced.<br /><br />I bought this device to replace a Sunbeam compact dryer, which replaced another Sunbeam, which was preceded by at least two Conairs, and a parade of various compact (mostly) dryers over the last 32 years.

I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!<br /><br />To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.<br /><br />I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).<br /><br />The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.<br /><br />Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.

It's a 'Hair' Dryer!,"I wasn't in the market for a new hair dryer but, thanks to my husband, who deep sixed my old one using it to thaw frozen water pipes at our cabin, I needed a new one. He thought the dryer just needed to 'rest' for a bit and then it would be 'fine' . . . so he didn't bother to tell me it had blown its last burst of air under our kitchen sink! I now needed to find a replacement hair dryer, something impossible to do on a Holiday when all the stores are closed and you need to be somewhere in half an hour!<br />FYI: If you, too, have a husband who has to thaw water pipes and has used your hair dryer, for that purpose, I suggest you point him in the direction of the [[ASIN:B00004TI25 Milwaukee 6 Dual Temperature Heat Gun]]. If he takes the hint you can avoid having to go to a 'Very Important Family Event' scaring small children (and some adults, I might add!) looking like a demented survivor from a shipwreck! I still cannot fathom why steam coming out of my ears and fire from the burning coals in my eyes didn't dry my hair! Where was a hot flash when I needed one? I'm over it - or I will be as soon as all the pictures and negatives have been destroyed! However, I digress, so back to my review.<br />I am glad I selected this hair dryer. It has proved to be an excellent choice. Dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier which is saying a lot since I have gray hair that has a mind of its own.

One of the things that I have come to really appreciate about this dryer is that the low fan setting truly is low. So many other dryers give you high and higher as choices. I don't want to achieve the head out the car window look, I want just enough airflow to get the job done. Of course, there is a high setting if you do want more.

I went thru two of the Sharper images ones (first one broke) which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head.<br /><br />Problems gone since I bought this. It is an awesome hair dryer. It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord. On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image) and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy. At a price between $18 and $22 this is the hair dryer to buy. I did, and only wish I had known about this hair dryer earlier. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Update on 9/26/2009: Almost 3 years later we're still on the same hair dryer. The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet. It has been dropped a few times too. For the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom. Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won't last long.<br /><br />Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place.

Amazon won't send a third replacement but they did refund my credit card. I don't know if the other Jerdon 1600W dryer that Amazon sells at $34.95 is any better(?).,2/4/2006

After reading the great reviews, I figured I would give it a try and hope for the best. I was so eager to try it this morning that I didn't even let my hair partially air dry like I normally do!!  I have never timed how long it takes to dry my hair as I take my time, do part, get tired and come back to it, etc.  My hair is super thick and longish (past my shoulders by a few inches.)  SO, I start to dry my hair and not only did it seem that it dried much faster, but I was able to get it SO much straighter than with my cheapo ionic dryer that I had been using previously.  I usually dry as well as I can and then have to spend another 10 minutes with the iron to smooth out the mess.  I only used the iron for a small section in the back that I hadn't hit well enough with the dryer.  My husband even commented that my hair looked pretty today (I didn't tell him I bought a new dryer!!!!)",1/18/2006

I purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord, and love it!  The added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly, but it was the cord feature that sold me.  Warning: as the previous reviewer mentioned, cats don't like this dryer.  When the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as I pull the cord to plug it in.  Otherwise, it's a great little dryer.",1/13/2006

He is definitely less afraid of this one which is a huge plus. I use it myself and find that it doesn't take me any longer to dry my hair than usual. I also like that it is lightweight. I can't compare it to other hair dryers that claim to be super quiet. However, I would say that is misleading. It is not super quiet, but it is more quiet than our regular hair dryer. A negative for me is the placement of the control/setting buttons. They are right where I place my fingers to grip the base of the dryer and because the switch sort of softly rolls up down to change from both high-medium-low and from cool-warm-hot, I often unintentionally switch from hot to cold. I had to concentrate to hold my fingers away from the switches, away from where they would naturally rest. This hair dryer's switches should be made in such a way that they do not change so easily. A more gear-like switch (that firmly clicks and stays into separate positions) might have solved this design problem.",1/5/2006

I showed up at Sephora expecting to pay $50 and saw that it was well over $200.  I bit the bullet and purchased it anyway and it's worth every penny.  My hair has never been softer or shinier.  In fact, it's improved over just towel drying.  Yes, it dries faster and is lighter, but as a male this was a less critical issue.  I really love how it leaves my hair soft, easily manageable (no static), and healthy.  Last week I bought one for my mom and more people are getting them for Christmas.",12/8/2005

However, I bought it because I had several expections about its features.  Here is how each feature measured up:<br />Quicker?  NO.  It may even take a little longer than a standard 1875-watt dryer.  The reason is that the fan does not blow very hard.  The high setting blows about like the low setting on a standard dryer.<br />Reduced frizz/flyaways/static? YES.  These are significantly reduced.<br />Increased shine?  YES.  My hair is visibly shinier.<br />Quieter?  YES, but qualified.  The only reason it is quieter is because it doesn't blow air as hard as a regular dryer.<br />Freshens hair?  YES.  <br />Another drawback:  This dryer is very heavy.  It took me several days to get used to how heavy it is.<br />This dryer delivers almost all of what ionic hairdryers promise, but I was mostly hoping for a dryer to speed drying time.  If you have thin hair or hair that dries quickly or have plenty of time to dry your hair, then I would highly recommend this dryer.  My hair looks shinier and healthier.",3/2/2002
